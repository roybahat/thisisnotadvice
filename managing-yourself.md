# Managing yourself

### Learning

#### [**How do I decide who to ask for advice?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1mrxmEneVBZxy) ****&#x20;

You get advice constantly. You're thinking about starting a company, you get advice. You decide to have a kid, you get advice. So how do you decide who to actually take advice from?

\[Tiffany: I'm someone who is the cumulative investment of a lot of people who have given me great advice. I love asking for it. In fact, my youngest sister says that I'm quite boring because I never want to learn a lesson myself. I'm very happy to just get advice from other people.]

All of us are on a journey that's a team sport, not a solo endeavor, so advice is really important. But you need to **be mindful of whether or not you really need advice -- or if you really need something else**. Advice is about providing explicit guidance about your decisionmaking and the ensuing actions that you need to take.&#x20;

In some cases, you don't need advice, you just need affirmation. Maybe you've already decided what you're going to do, or deep down inside you know what  you should do. It's okay to ask for confirmation of your judgment, without seeking advice.

If you decide that you do need advice, it's important to go to multiple people. Never take advice from just one person. And it's helpful to seek advice from  different types of people:

* A sage: Someone who is seasoned or experienced in whatever area you need advice on.
* An execution expert: People who can be helpful with the execution, so when it's time to take action, they can support.&#x20;
* Your already-existing network: People who know you really well, and in different contexts, who can tell you the truth about yourself. This doesn't mean just friends, but maybe someone who you've worked with before, etc.
* Your "Cru": People who care about you, but are not invested in your decision-making and have a level of objectivity. What you decide is not going to have a huge impact on their life.

\[Tiffany: [The Cru](https://msha.ke/thecru/) matches circles of women who collaborate to meet their life goals. Members say they really appreciate is that "My Cru" is a group of people who care about me, but aren't invested in my decision making. This adds a lot of value.]

By going to multiple people for advice, you can do some pattern matching about what they all have to say. \[Tiffany: For example, when I asked four women about advice for getting married, they all had very different things to say, but all four said we should wait to have children. Otherwise, they had very different things to say, but the fact that they all made this recommendation made me really think about that perspective.]

So be mindful of whether or not you really need advice – or just affirmation – and if you do need advice, seek multiple types of people for input.

#### _****_[**When I need to learn something as a busy person, how do I do it?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1PlKQNVnraNGE) ****&#x20;

Find two people that have extreme points of view on something that you are not deep on. Often, at least one of the people won't be closely aligned to your point of view.&#x20;

It's helpful to talk things out, understand the issue, engage with the issue, ask questions. It can be easier to get people to chat when you're more established, but you can always look for someone with an extreme point of view.&#x20;

And then you find people who you click with, who have an extreme point of view, you can keep going back to them about the same subject.&#x20;

#### [**What can I learn from famous luminaries and how they operate?** ](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1PlKQNVnraNGE?t=21m49s)****

There's a misconception that celebrities or luminaries don't work as hard, they just chill because they've mastered their craft. It turns out they're just as insecure about themselves as the rest of us and this insecurity doesn't go away. They take their insecurity and channel it into learning and working hard.They love feedback and want to know how they can change (not so different from great founders).

The most successful celebrities and luminaries want to hear other people's perceptions not so they can decide how to react, but to see if there is a solution and if they can solve for it.

### Managing your state of mind

#### [I have impostor syndrome. What do I do?!](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1lPJqVvWdoNxb)

\[Ed.: I've felt a lot of impostor syndrome in my life, ever since my first real job as an advisor to people in business -- [when I knew nothing about business!](https://linkedin.com/in/roybahat) -- and still feel it frequently. And at the same time, I'm a straight white man and that means there are certain feelings others may have when they enter a room to which I would struggle to relate.]

Whenever you feel impostor syndrome, you're probably not the only one. Most people are more focused on themselves, whether they fit in, than on judging everybody else. (You may, without realizing it, have given someone else impostor syndrome! Not that that necessarily helps you.) The feeling of being an impostor may never go away, though you can learn how to manage it.

Start by sticking to what you know -- often that's your personal story. It's harder to talk about general issues (like your company's strategy) than about your personal experience. It's also more important than ever to be conscious of where you come from -- and the limitations of your own perspective.

You also don't always have to have an opinion. Sometimes it's okay to just ask a question. Sometimes we feel we're just "supposed to know" what to do -- school teaches us that. It's okay not to know. It's okay to just say, "I have no idea."&#x20;

#### [Why do I feel sad about work when everybody tells me that I should be happy?](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1mrGmQMgvVWGy)

There's privilege in even getting to ask yourself this question; it's no less real of a problem.&#x20;

Managing yourself is a skill that you can learn. [Happiness is an inside job](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NB1TUU/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?\_encoding=UTF8\&btkr=1), more than just your response to the things happening around you. We're just at the very beginning of figuring this out as a society. A venture capitalist said "[the hardest part about being CEO is managing your own psychology](https://a16z.com/2011/03/31/whats-the-most-difficult-ceo-skill-managing-your-own-psychology/)" and it's true -- it's also true for everyone, not just CEO's, and it's harder if you're from an underrepresented background.

Others can look at you and think, "oh, you're on top of the world" -- and yet you don't feel that way. People who are wildly successful can be miserable -- there are miserable moguls. Let's be honest, aren't we all fascinated with some leaders specifically because their life can be like watching a car crash? And so it's not easy to be them. You don't know what it's like to be them.

**Why do we have these problems about sadness at work?** We suffer in part because we know what our story is like on the inside -- and we compare that to what others _seem like_ on the outside. And the comparison is so painful. We don't know anyone else's private struggles. Maybe you're sad at work because of childhood things, maybe it's biochemistry, maybe it's society as a whole (racism or sexism, for example). Maybe you've been mistreated at work and your sadness is a response to mistreatment. Happiness seems uncorrelated with how "well you are doing" and how happy you "should" feel.

Many startup founders, for example, at the very moment when their company starts to take off, seem to fall apart. There are moments where everybody thinks you're going to run a victory lap and you're going to celebrate, but really you may be suffering. Not to deny the challenge of many people who are suffering with even harder things to deal with, with abuse at work or economic existence struggles.

Organizations, in general, are still terrible at creating environments where people are happy. Many organizations encourage employees to wear misery as a badge of honor.&#x20;

You can embark on the quest of trying to figure out why you, specifically, are feeling this. There's a skill in understanding your own psychology, your thoughts, your emotions, your sense of self. You can get better at it.&#x20;

**Figuring out why you are sad may start with seeking some professional support**, if you can get it. Coaching, therapy, a group therapy retreat, endless reading. [Dushka Zapata](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-coach-more-knowledgeable-people-than-yourself-as-in-executive-coaching/answer/Dushka-Zapata?ch=10\&share=0241aee9\&srid=70yN) tells this story about a CEO she was coaching: Imagine a very smart person standing on top of a hill. She can see everything: the hills, the valleys, the houses, the sky. She can see much more than me. But I can see her."

**Develop a realistic perspective on how one handles sadness at work**. Some people think it's a thing you "fix." You tweak the settings of you're life, and then you're all set! It's not like that. It's more like a practice: addressing sadness requires constant care and feeding. Experiment with different techniques.

#### [I feel jealous at work, like when someone got promoted ahead of me... and shame. What do I do?](https://twitter.com/roybahat/status/1268707645017346049)

First, we all do have envy and shame. The [TED talk by Brene Brown on shame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psN1DORYYV0) is about the _value_ shame can have. You need to work on yourself so you can show up for others. Often our bad behaviors we have at work, where we backbite someone or do something awful, are actually just because we're feeling terrible. Those negative behaviors often stem from our envy and shame.

The first thing is notice it and observe it happened. Try to figure out for yourself what caused it. Often it's making a comparison to somebody else. And, of first you say, "well, of course, that's what happens." Then the next time you can think, "Well, do I really want to start comparing myself to this person? It will make me feel bad."

The second thing is that there's a power in naming it -- the envy, or the shame -- and just saying it out loud. Or writing it down. Or if you have a friend you trust,  saying, "I am embarrassed because I feel jealous of X." They might try to reassure you, which isn't always the right answer. (Remember that if someone comes to you.) Instead they might just say, "Yeah, that feels like crap, I bet." They might just see you, and that can feel fantastic.

You may be on the giving end of shame inadvertently when you brag (or humblebrag) about something without intending it -- be aware.&#x20;

And the last thing: get help. Help could look like reading about it: what causes envy, what causes shame. Consider therapy -- if you have health insurance, often health insurance covers it. You may even want to go deeper. There's a week long program run by a nonprofit called the [Hoffman Institute](https://www.hoffmaninstitute.org/the-process/) that looks at what causes these triggers in us. And often, it's because somebody reminds us of an event as a kid that made us feel bad. So notice it, name it, and try to get some help and avoid causing it and others.&#x20;

It's also helpful to remind yourself of what you can control. Recognize that whoever you envy, you have no idea what they're dealing with, either.

#### [How do I share with my team that I'm struggling with my mental health?](https://www.pscp.tv/w/cdZTRjFsWktwWXhYSnhvam58MUJkR1luTFl2VllKWEMdTH4DB5iCLQCZoNXeZ0XGlyBXP1soJXqJKuJ-24AY)

It's terrific that you've named this struggle in yourself -- that's the first step to doing something about it. \[Ed.: I've struggled with depression and anxiety. I believe in talking about it, so we can open the door for others. A colleague with whom I've collaborated, Lenny Mendonca, had a career in business and then was an advisor to Governor Newsom. Lenny announced that the reason he had [resigned from his post to seek treatment for depression](https://twitter.com/Lenny\_Mendonca/status/1280548309971550208), and those steps are in the right direction.]

**Seek support for yourself.** If you can afford it or you've got access, consider getting professional help -- i.e., a therapist. (If you're insured, this is often covered by insurance.) \[Ed.: I resisted this for a long time because I refused to see myself as "having a problem." It took a little trial and error; now I see therapy, like coaching, as essential. Now I see it as a tool for living life better.] You can ask a friend you trust, and look at resources online.

As far as your co-workers go, the first question you might ask: _**should**_** you talk to your team?** In an ideal world, you might think, "Yes, everybody should be open." Some people have forms of privilege where they feel comfortable sharing their mental health issues without worrying too much about the consequences in their professional life -- and not everybody is in a position to do that. Everyone has a different lived experience, and some folks may face bias or discrimination, or work at a company where the culture makes talking about your mental health unacceptable. There's some tradecraft in figuring out if you should say something -- what's the cost of staying silent (suffering alone, getting less help) vs. the cost of speaking up (some possible limitation in future opportunities, though that may be something you're imagining).

If you can speak up, it might be a wonderful thing. Others on your team or in your coworking space might know how to relate to you differently. They might support you and send resources. They might just know you better as a person; you might feel less anxious at work about carrying this secret with you.

The business culture around mental health is changing: there's now a way of talking about it that's more palatable to folks. Paraphrasing Lenny Mendonca, "I'm not ashamed when I fall off my bike and break my arm. Why would I be ashamed if I've got something broken in my most important organ, my brain?"

**You can, as always,** [**start gradually**](https://also.roybahat.com/the-trust-thing-691791a4c6ca)**.** If you see someone else at work who has talked about it, maybe you go to them and you say, "Hey, I've noticed you've talked about your anxiety or your bipolar diagnosis. I might want to do the same." If you get professional help from, e.g., your therapist they might have ideas on how to talk about it.

Eventually you may be in a position where you can talk openly with a team. You may be even in a position where you can talk openly with the world -- and then everybody knows.

### Productivity

#### [How can I produce predictably when my work is fundamentally unpredictable?](https://www.pscp.tv/w/ccKe-jFsWktwWXhYSnhvam58MU1ueG5kVlhnQkVHTwWY\_xuoGxO4Hz10kj0gzUmouOL4zW8JfttOwZ1KI0Lp)

In many professions, ranging from creating software to writing a novel, your delivery output is unpredictable because often you're trying something new.&#x20;

How do you measure work? The mental models are often descendants of the industrial factory era and scientific management. A real problem is figuring out how these models apply to _creative_ work.

It starts with your own emotional health: many problems that we have around work stem from believing we're not good enough. Often, people are unsure about their work's predictability and become ashamed -- unwilling to say they're unsure when they will be able to deliver -- and go quiet.&#x20;

To prevent that happening, first recognize in yourself that there's unpredictability to your work.&#x20;

Then try to create an environment where others understand the nature of the problem you're trying to solve. For example, if your manager asks on Monday for you to ship a feature by Tuesday and you don't know if it can be built, try to talk about it. Explain to them why it's unpredictable. Their fear is that you're just looking to go slowly and not produce. Try to reduce that fear by sharing with them what you'll do to better predict the outcomes of your own work.

Take an example of an unpredictable piece of work \[Ed. from my own work as a venture capitalist]: "How long will it take you to find a good investment?" That's impossible to predict accurately. So what _could_ you describe accurately? One approach is to focus on inputs: e.g., you could measure the number of companies you meet on a monthly basis. &#x20;

The trick is picking inputs that really matter to the outputs -- most of the time people end up measuring nonsense for the sake of measuring _something_.&#x20;

Boundary setting is another way of creating predictability out of unpredictable days. Maybe you'll just say "I'll spend 90 minutes on this problem and see how far I get and let you know." [Deep Work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) offers a perspective on how to set boundaries for creative work. For another take, see the [Nap Ministry](https://www.instagram.com/thenapministry/?hl=en) -- an ode to rest as a form of self-care, which can help you show up to do your best work when you are ready.

### Vacation

#### ****[**What should I do my first day back from vacation?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1OyJAgAwZWeKb)****

If you are in the privileged position to take vacation, take it. People once prided themselves on how little vacation they took. These people were usually under-performers or, more accurately, they performed really well until they got to a certain point in their career -- and then they topped out. They could grind effectively to get done what was expected of them but the unusual insights, the creativity, never arrived.

If you can take vacation, chances are you're in a job where what matters is not the average of your contributions on any given day -- what matters is the _peak_ of your contribution. When do you have your most creative insight, when you do your best piece of writing, and how good are you at your peak? The professional value of taking a vacation is that it raises the height of your peaks. It also allows you to enjoy your life more, and work at its best should enable you to fully inhabit life and enjoy it.

When you decide to take a vacation, **prepare before you go away.** Recognize that your first day back is not going to be a normal day and should instead be a day to catch up: no unusual meetings, etc. Otherwise the Sunday before that Monday becomes that "first day."

Set expectations with others about what you expect while you're away. Say, "when I come back, I'd like to see X, Y, and Z done." Your out-of-office email can also help set these expectations. \[Ed.: Our team keeps a running document when someone is away, so we can give them one place to see everything when they're back. I tend to set a "portcullis dropped" out-of-office-message, which says something to the effect of "if you need to break glass, in case of emergency, and ruin my vacation, you can reach me by contorting in the following way."]

When you come back, take the chance to reset your habits. Think about if there are 10-15% of your projects that aren't necessary to do at all. That exercise, of letting go,  makes you feel good and can free up attention to focus in a more worthwhile direction.

When you go away, oftentimes you have insights about work; maybe you're reading something and it makes you think big thoughts. The former CEO and chairman of Citigroup, John Reed, wrote the ["memo from the beach,"](https://blog.citigroup.com/2012/09/citi-turns-200-focus-shifts-to-retail-banking) where he laid the groundwork for the launch of Citibank's ATM network, transforming the banking system. If you're going to send that kind of missive, hold it for a beat, send it once you get back (Reed may have written the memo on the beach, but in those days it's unlikely he sent it from there), and think on it. The bigger the shift, the less likely it is that it'll stick (in your mind) once you get back to reality. One of the worst things you can do, especially if you're a leader who has people take direction from you, is create whiplash. While you may have amazing new idea for a product, you're also unaware of everything going on while you're out. The bigger the insight, the more material the idea, the longer you should wait before you share it. Marination is helpful.

#### ****[**What are ways to take time off during a pandemic?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1rmxPYrBvryKN)****

**Start by expressing your intent to take time off**, ideally well in advance (a couple of months is usually plenty). If your vacation comes out of the blue because you're overwhelmed and need to pull the emergency stop cord, that's better than not taking vacation, but may throw your co-workers into disarray. The further in advance you telegraph your intent to take time off, especially during a pandemic, the better.

Think about how your time off will affect your team, and start a conversation. "Hey, would it create any issues if I went away on such and such date?"

Think about what you want to spend your non-work time doing. Maybe you want to unplug from digital devices. Give yourself the permission to say, "I don't have to be on my laptop, on my phone all day, every day." Maybe you want to dig deeper into a hobby, like baking or drawing.&#x20;

Before the pandemic, vacation meant an automatic change in context because you stopped coming to the office. In a pandemic, you need to intentionally change your context. This could mean you're not going to open your laptop, or that you change your home screen on your phone because it's really beneficial to not be looking at your email app all the time. These changes in context, whether the physical environment or digital environment, can make a big difference.

Consider vacations outdoors, like going camping if you can afford to do that. If you do stay at home, find a way to change your routine so it's different from "I'm still doing the same thing, just not at my laptop."

### **Coaching**

[**How do I get the most out of my coach?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1dRKZZDeBbNKB)****

Coaches in the business world have become more popular, with new services offering coaching to a broader set of people. \[Ed.: We invested in [Sounding Board](https://www.soundingboardinc.com).] Great athletes have coaches at all levels, so why shouldn't business people?

Start by asking your coach how to best work with them. They won't necessarily have a plan or process laid out for you on day one, so you should think about what you want to want to get out of it.

Coaches usually work with you in two main ways: 1) Addressing dilemmas or opportunities that are "alive" for you in that moment and 2) partnering with you on a longer-term growth arc.

With a coach you can dive into pressing issues like, "Somebody made me really angry when they did this" or "I can't figure out how to get my team to do this thing" or "I've got a big strategic choice to make." Your coach can help you make these important, immediate decisions in front of you.&#x20;

While you do that, you should have some sense of your longer-term areas for growth Consider setting six-month goals, diging in deep, and working together on a longer quest.

One of the most important reasons to have a coach is to enlist someone whose only role is to support _you_. Some of the results come merely from sharing with the coach, and making a dedicated time and space to reflect.&#x20;

The cumulative effect of coaching over time can be powerful. Some of this comes down to consistency of practice. If you don't see results after one session, that may be because it takes longer to see if it's working. That said, if you're not feeling chemistry with your coach then it's unlikely you'll get the most out of it -- it might be time to look for a new coach.

Everybody should feel empowered to have somebody in their corner mopping their brow.

### Working remotely

[**How do I stay sane while working remotely?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1BRJjYlWRaRGw)****

At the onset of Covid-19, many executives at big companies said things like, "I never believed in remote work. I thought work from home was an excuse to not work, but now I see it's so efficient."

When you're working from home, you spend almost every minute "at work" doing something -- call after call, or typing emails or chat messages. Unlike working in an office, there are few of the natural moments where you can rest your mind -- even commuting probably gave you a break. This can leave you feeling exhausted.

\[Ed.: I remember for me, for the first month of working remotely during Covid-19, I felt peak productive and then suddenly I just got overwhelmed all at once.]

The physics are different when you're working from home all the time. And if you talk to people who've been doing it for a long time, they'll give you lots of wisdom.&#x20;

**Think about how you can challenge the assumptions of how the workplace is meant to work.** For example, for working parents with kids, many workplaces are asking them to work the same way they did before the pandemic. Feel the power to challenge that -- push back. Maybe you need to trade off with your partner and spend time with your kids. The first step is naming the challenge: "I know you think we should be on 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM the way we were before, but that's just not working for me because..."

Next, if you're going to be effective, **you need to take care of yourself, putting on your own oxygen mask before you take care of others.** For each person, this means something different and **you should experiment with techniques.** Maybe it's calendaring time away from your screen to take time to think. In an office setting, you get some of this time because of your habits, e.g., catching your breath when walking from one meeting to another. In a remote setting, you may need to schedule this time.&#x20;

\[Ed.: my wife [Sara](https://twitter.com/sarafenskebahat) is now using the 50-minute meeting convention, so she has 10 minutes free between any two appointments.]&#x20;

**For many of us, sanity involves other people** – in both our personal lives and work lives. Set aside time just to connect with people. Dedicate a half hour to ask "How are you doing?" and treat it as more than a cursory, passing question. Maybe it's a meal together, or an activity. \[Ed.: At Bloomberg Beta, we're doing team activities like an origami class...] These modes of connection don't have to be expensive.&#x20;

[**My company is remote for the rest of the year. Should I consider moving?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1mrGmElLnzgGy)****

Once, _the_ single most important career choice you'd make was, arguably, where to live. (If you're fortunate enough to have that choice, consider yourself lucky!) Today, with many companies going remote, it's hard to say if this is the case anymore. \[Ed.: I am writing this in July 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic when many companies have gone remote for the foreseeable future.]

When working remotely, **you have an opportunity to re-evaluate your life priorities**. There's no obvious answer, as to whether to stay where you are or move -- even while plenty of advocates for remote work tell you that you'd be crazy to stay in a big city.

Think for yourself: Where do you live and where would you want to live? Where are your communities? How close are you to your extended family and would you want that to change? How much flexibility do you have with your work and do you need to consider time zones if you make a change? Do you have personal constraints or strong preferences around things like a city's walkability or bikeability?

Make a list and rank your priorities. What came up as number one? How does this map to where you may want to be a year from now, or five or 10?

Might you may want or _need_ to go back to the office? Where do you want to be when that happens and how much of a priority will it be for you personally and professionally to be able to go into the office?&#x20;

**Weigh your personal considerations against your team's capabilities.** Has remote work made your team more or less communicative? More or less flexible? \[Ed.: At Bloomberg Beta, the lockdown has made our team more communicative and given us even more flexibility, and this has caused me to think bigger about what's possible for my living- and work-options.]

In some cases, your geography may still matter. Your new job may need you in a certain region.

Remote work has led to a grand set of experiments as we all try to figure out our own priorities and what matters to each of us, and reorganize accordingly. We still don't know the right answers, and only you know the right answer for yourself.

### Getting things done / productivity

#### [How should I get more done?](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1RDxlQAZbDDKL)&#x20;

Start with one list: your "offense list." This is a list of the things you want to achieve each day. It could be a few short things. It could be one thing.

There's a tool called [WorkFlowy](https://workflowy.com) \[Ed.: Bloomberg Beta invested in it]. It's a listkeeping piece of software. Use that, or something else you prefer. It's easier for it to be digital because it carries over to the next day. And then first priority in terms of time in the day, it's called "eat the frog," do the undesirable thing, just get it done. You know, in [_The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_](https://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful/dp/0743269519), they talk about things that are important, but not urgent, as the highest priority things -- do those.&#x20;

The second part is to have a "defense list," e.g., email. These are the things you must do even if they don't advance your main goals. You could even put to-dos in email to keep it all in one place.

Practice [Inbox Zero](https://www.fastcompany.com/40507663/the-7-step-guide-to-achieving-inbox-zero-and-staying-there-in-2018). If you have multiple inboxes like text, WhatsApp, Twitter, Telegram, you should get to Inbox Zero them all. Probably one of them is your primary inbox and try to push everything there if you possibly can. Do email as few times per day as possible, and process it in a batch. Spend the rest of your time, as much of it as possible, playing offense.

The tools you use will change a lot over time. Constantly re-examine your process because there's always a way to keep getting better and better at this, to be doing things that are more important as opposed to just saving time. When it comes to productivity, keep throwing out the baby with the bath water. And when in doubt, focus on typing faster.

#### [How can I get things done during a crisis?](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1RDxlQAZbDDKL)

Sometimes that's just hard. Be easy on yourself, be compassionate at yourself. Sometimes you have to progress without knowing if you're going in the right direction. Look up, seek support from your friends, and do your best to move in the right direction.

****[**How do I avoid feeling overwhelmed by the flow of information?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1yNxaBdBmoDKj)

There's a myth that information overload is a modern phenomenon.&#x20;

\[Ed.: I teach a business school class at UC Berkeley on media and I start the course with this [quote](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1279403-adagia) from Erasmus from the 16th century:&#x20;

“Is there anywhere on earth exempt from these swarms of new books? Even if, taken out one at a time, they offered something worth knowing, the very mass of them would be an impediment to learning from satiety if nothing else."]

Information overload comes from expecting you can read or consume more media than you can. (Here we'll focus on news, since catching up on email or instant messages, Slack, etc. is a separate subject.)

**Separate out the informational value from the aspect that's compulsive** -- an addiction. It's fun during the day to check in, go look at Twitter for a minute or Daily Mail. **As long as you're aware you're indulging, it can be OK.** Otherwise, pick your information diet. It can feel like you're making progress when you read a lot of headlines and doomscroll on Twitter, but it might not be serving you in a particularly helpful way. So catch yourself when you're doing that.

**Be precise about which kinds of information you need, when you need them, and why.** Then read the things that give you that knowledge in a systematic (even if it's a limited) way. There may be some things that you must know to do your job. \[Ed.: For example, with what we do at Bloomberg Beta, there are certain things we need to know. We need to know which big new investments got announced that day because we might be talking about it with others, or we might talk to somebody involved and want to congratulate them. In this case, I look at any one of several wonderful tech newsletters.]&#x20;

Some items you must know immediately -- for example, a news story that mentions your company might be important to know right away. (You can use Google's [Alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts) to follow that.) Other things are OK to catch up on at the end of the day. Many things that seem important in the morning blow over by the afternoon.

Other content is more of a "nice to read," enriching your perspective. While this kind of content is hardly ever _necessary_ to doing your job in any given day, the most successful people tend to be curious and consume information to indulge that curiosity. Many people go in "campaign mode" on this kind of enriching content, focusing on one topic deeply, turning it all off for a while, or other methods for mixing it up. It's a myth that there's one "right way" to consume media that should last you forever.

Think about which people you might need to know about. LinkedIn automatically emails you when someone you know is [mentioned in the news](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/50021/mentioned-in-the-news-feature?lang=en). \[Ed.: This technology comes from [Newsle](https://newsle.com), which was our first investment at Bloomberg Beta.] Before you have a first meeting with someone, try to research them.&#x20;

**Choose your tools with care.** [Nuzzel](https://developers.nuzzel.com) can give you the news your friends shared over the course of the last week, for example -- so it's good for catching up when you've been away. Choose newsletters carefully, and consider whether to use [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) or some other service to save the nice-to-read content for later.

Newsletters can be extremely useful, because their writers often curate news for you. You can also then focus on reading them only once, to batch all your reading. \[Ed. There are people I always read, for example [Jason Hirschhorn](https://redef.com/info/about), the king of media newsletters, and his REDEF was for years my go-to for following things in an intensive way because it was curated.]

You can also work to retain more of what you consume: [Tiago Forte](https://fortelabs.co/blog/) lays out a [framework](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/) for information that is useful, valuable and interesting, and finding where those circles overlap.&#x20;

**If you miss some news, skip stressing about it.** Somebody may say, "Oh, you didn't hear about that?" And you can say, "Actually, no. I didn't." Have the strength to admit when you haven't read something and ask for more information. Your time is often more important than staying up to date on every last development in your industry.

[**My company is growing. How do I keep track of what's going on?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1ynKOqDDjoQJR)****

As your company grows, you might find that you are no longer able to keep track of what is going on and stay on top of everything. Once you have accepted this, you can focus on staying on top of the important things, which can be identified using a sensing system.

The first part of this answer is: don't try and know everything that is going on. Instead of trying to stay on top of everything, solve the problem by coming to the realization that you can’t stay on top of everything. Struggling to manage everything is common when your company grows and you hire more people to get leverage. With this growth, you’re probably going to need to operate at a different level of structure. Bringing more people on means that you are going to need to get comfortable with not knowing, and let your team do what they were hired to do.&#x20;

The second part directly follows the first part: if you know that you aren’t going to pay attention to everything, how will you pay attention to the right things?&#x20;

A way to make sure that you know about the right things is to have a sensing system in place. A sensing system will tell you when something goes wrong, or especially right, and will draw your attention to what needs input from you. Your sensing system can be through software, human processes, or interactions with different people. What form your sensing system takes is not important, as long as it allows you to understand the complex organism that is your company.

\[Ed.: When Dan was at Medium, the team grew to a size where he could no longer know what each team member was doing. Dan felt that he didn’t know much about what his Eng team was up to, and so when it came to reporting their progress to the Exec team, he didn’t have much to share.&#x20;

He then started having those Eng teams try and send him a report on Friday that he could then relate to the Exec team. But unfortunately, this wasn’t successful as noone wanted to report to him just for the sake of reporting to him.&#x20;

So, he ended up creating a sensing system that could broadcast information to the whole company. Instead of team members giving information to him, he facilitated the flow of  information to the rest of the company. He was then able to highlight their work and represent it to the company through the weekly engineering report.]

Creating a broadcasting system like Dan’s is one way to set up a sensing system, but really what you need are rituals and cadence. The sensing system is built on top of rituals, and they have to be weekly, daily, monthly, and yearly. You can then build up that cadence of communication.&#x20;

One way to incorporate a ritual is by using Range. If your team checks in with you routinely, you can assess how they are answering the team question and how their mood is. You can use these things to decide if you should look at something in more detail and go into their day-to-day work. Noticing when your team members aren’t acting as they usually do can allow you to be alerted when they are struggling or need more support.&#x20;

You may think that a sensing system is about dealing with information that is present, but it is actually also about dealing with the absence of information. Oftentimes, when people on a team are struggling, they stop being forthcoming in their communication. In these cases, you take notice of the absence of information. If someone you usually hear from every day suddenly goes quiet, that is your signal that something may be wrong.&#x20;

As your company increases in size, you probably aren’t going to be able to know everything that is going on in your company. Instead, you can strive to know the important things, which a sensing system can help bring to your attention.

### Managing your reputation

[**Is there a right way to brag?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1ynJOqoEbgXKR)****

\[Ed.: As a straight white man, there are certain aspects of bragging that, when I do them, are going to read differently than for other people. I'm also in the U.S., and cultures about self-promotion differ dramatically from place to place]&#x20;

Yes, there is a right way to brag. We often think of bragging as being a bad thing, and it can be done in an awful way.

First, unload the language: instead of calling it a "brag," for a moment think of it as "talking about good things that you are doing" or "talking about good things about yourself." Should you do that? **Check in with yourself on your reasons for talking about that part of yourself.** If it's that you're feeling insecure and you want to address the insecurity, you should stop and reassess. It takes practice to see your own reasons clearly.

There can be great reasons to brag. If you believe that by sharing some achievement of your company, it will make your employees feel proud, that could be a great reason.

\[[Minn](https://twitter.com/minney\_cat): As a woman, I've experienced that it is often scarier to brag because you think that it will be read a certain way and probably received differently.]

It takes practice. Sometimes you'll feel like you went too far. And you'll also figure out the moments when you feel confident saying, "Okay, I do want to brag about this."&#x20;

**When you figure out that you do want to brag about something, how do you do it?**&#x20;

There's a distinction between talking about things you've achieved versus talking about your own qualities. Donald Trump says, "I'm the greatest," which means nothing. It's so much more compelling to point to an achievement and say, "I'm so proud that our company reached this milestone."

You can make it even easier on yourself by being concrete. What did you contribute? What was the outcome? What ways did you help or support the people or the cause? Then articulate how you feel about the accomplishment -- why you are proud, for example. And instead of thinking about it as bragging, think about it as a way to signal to other people what you care about.

Recognize the goal of the brag, if there's a professional goal, and shape how you do it to support the goal. \[Ed.: I often brag on behalf of founders who we've invested in, to elevate their achievements, tagging [#proudinvestor](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23proudinvestor%20%40roybahat\&src=typed\_query\&f=live). Or I point to somebody on our team to direct the brag in a way that supports that goal.]

Also think about how your brag is going to read. Sometimes it's going to read like bragging. **There can be a price to bragging, but you can't succeed without paying prices.** Ask if you are getting more value than the price that you paid. If your goal is to never be looked at askance, you'll never brag. And you will be fighting with one arm tied behind your back compared to all the people who can.

#### [I work at a company and am building a startup on the side. Should I be public about what I am doing?](https://www.pscp.tv/w/ccqLiTFsWktwWXhYSnhvam58MVBsSlFObFBEZHZ4RV4L2mx1WQ5LtJx8yyoqkHwNQCgJ1Xu\_UiCXhsGgYBKq)

Know your company's views on this: at some companies, they want you to stay absolutely quiet on social media. There are companies that don't care. If you work for a company that will fire you for tweeting anything, and you like working at that company,  maybe you should not tweet. Make a judgment.

And then there's you, how do you want to approach being public?There's no mandate to build a public profile for yourself. Plenty of wildly successful people have done without.

This is a "horses for courses" issue where you have to find your own way. If your reason for building a profile is for the sake of having a profile, that usually doesn't work. If your reason for building a profile is you genuinely want to express something and engage with people, that's great.&#x20;

You have to be savvy about how you do it. Try to be public a little bit at a time and see how it goes. Know which issues are hot buttons for your employer.

\[Ed.: I run a venture capital fund that carries the name of a person who spent decades building his reputation. I respect that. I try to use judgment about when it would affect his reputation for me to express myself. I'll go to a communications person at my company and ask, "If I say this thing, will it cause issues?" And sometimes the answer is yes, it will cause issues, and I say it anyway, because it's that important. And sometimes the answer is, "Yes, it's going to cause issues," and I think twice.]&#x20;

Too often people, when they're unsure how to handle a tricky situation like being public about their private projects, resort to absolutes. "Well, I should never say anything," or, "I should have an unambiguous right to say whatever I wish." The world just doesn't work that way. Develop the tradecraft of knowing when and how. Ask for feedback as you go.

#### [What do I do if a journalist contacts me for an interview?](https://www.pscp.tv/w/cc0iNDFsWktwWXhYSnhvam58MXZBR1JyallxZGdHbH6AqBmFHNbaxRKDu7pG3HHksNtW0tO6kOmHzQIcq9E0)

**Why is the journalist contacting you?** A journalist is a professional doing a job, which is to report on things that are interesting. They're trying to figure out how to write a useful story to reach their audience. (They're generally not reaching out to do you a favor -- so try to figure out what their "angle" is on their story.)&#x20;

There are rules of engagement and etiquette for how journalists generally approach things. Years ago,  a PR person at a company might connect you with a journalist and mediate the covnersation. Now you migh get a DM out of the blue from a journalist. "Hey, I write for \[some publication] I'd like to talk to you about your experience with \[suchandsuch]. Can we talk?" You might be terrified -- many people are in that moment -- because you're not quite sure what to do.

Try reading the journalist's prior work and figure out if you like it. Do you think they say useful and interesting things? And once you have a picture in your head, think to yourself: does it serve my interest to build a relationship with this journalist and talk to them about this story? It's about more than that one story.&#x20;

**You can ask the journalist questions to see if you want to talk.** You could say, "I haven't spoken to a journalist before. I'm curious, how does this work?" And oftentimes this should-we-talk exchange now happens in writing, over DM or email or text. You can even ask, "Is it possible for me to talk to you without being named in your story?" You can come to some agreement with a journalist, particularly if they've reached out to you. You can say you'd like to speak freely, so it would help if you could have the conversation off the record -- or you can ask, if they want to quote you, for them to run the quote by you first. If you don't agree that the conversation is [off the record or on background](https://www.ap.org/about/news-values-and-principles/telling-the-story/anonymous-sources), they are allowed to use anything you say to them. Agree on the terms of the discussion before you begin talking. After you've said something you regret, it's too late.

Anything you put in a journalist's inbox is fair game. Executives sometimes write to a journalist unsolicited and say, "We're announcing our new product on Tuesday." And then the journalist might write about the product on Tuesday without talking to them.

If you work at a big company, you need to know the rules of engagement for your company. Some companies won't let employees talk to journalists. If you company allows you to speak with a journalist, you can always (and probably should) check in with a communications professional at the company (i.e., a PR person).

**Once you're speaking with the journalist, try to have one idea you want to get across** -- and have it be something that fits what they're writing about. This is another example of "it's about them, not about you." Share stories, examples, evidence that supports your idea. Let the journalist ask you a bunch of questions.

Anticipate hard questions in advance -- a good journalist might try and catch you off guard. It's within their rights to do that -- they're trying to get at the truth. You can say "I don't feel comfortable talking about it." While journalists aren't there to puff you up or do you favors, if you understand how they work you can partner with them to get truth out there about what you're doing at work.
