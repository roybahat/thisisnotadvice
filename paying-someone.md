# Managing others

### Firing

#### [**When I get to the point that I'm almost certain I'm going to fire someone, should I put them on a performance plan to give them some warning?**](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1mnGelXLEaQKX?t=25m9s)

You should always give a person warning because it's the human thing to do. In some contexts, that warning might short: six hours because the person's work is so rapid fire and they're making errors at such a pace that they could ruin your entire company in that time. Most managers give their employees too much time, because most people can't fix their issues. Or by the time they have fixed the issues, the issues metastasize and create more lasting problems. (For example, a person who is chronically late for two months might start showing up on time, but it might be harder to fix the issue of the team's frustration with that formerly-late person's two months of leaving the team saddled with more work.)

You should give a person a "warning," in the form of feedback about their performance, the moment you start to have concerns. You can escalate the severity of the warning (from "I have some feedback" to, eventually, "you need to fix this if you want to stay at this company").

Take into account the life circumstances of the person in question. If they're the sole provider for others, that might change when and how you communicate with them, for example.

If you are the person who is having performance issues, and you receive a warning (sometimes in the form of a written "[performance improvement plan](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/how-to-guides/pages/performanceimprovementplan.aspx)" or "PIP") you might be able to save yourself. Just recognize that is usually a four alarm fire, and you need to act fast.

#### [**How do I fire someone?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1vAGRrqVgMDGl)

Imagine you've already made the decision to fire someone, and warned the person. As a leader, you want to treat everybody with dignity and respect — and great leaders tend to be good at letting people go, and it's a really important skill. Arguably, firing is a more important skill than hiring. (Even the best people at hiring are often wrong.) [There are also many reasons to fire someone, and context matters](https://www.growthpathlabs.com/p/how-to-fire-someone-with-humanity) — so firing someone with humanity takes that into account.

\[Ed.: The first time I fired somebody, it was awful. I agonized over whether to fire the person for months. I felt like a failure for having to fire the person, who I had worked so hard to recruit, and told my team would be an important contributor. The second I began agonizing over it, I should've just done it — my inner struggle was less about whether it was the right choice to fire the person (it was) and more about my own feelings of inadequacy. I've since evolved to be much more comfortable with the process, which is a skill.]

First, prepare by covering your logistics. Check what electronic systems this person can access (ideally you have some function in your company, like human resources, that can help with this), and make sure their email is turned off immediately and so on. It's usually best to do it all at once. Having the person stick around is not helpful for anybody.

The second thing is money. Oftentimes, you owe the person an unusual last paycheck because they may have unpaid vacation or something like that. And there's often a question of how much severance the person might receive. You have to think all that out — and have the person's paperwork ready for them to sign. And usually the person will receive their severance or final paycheck in exchange for a release promising not to disparage the company — you need to have that paper ready.

Try to be as generous as possible. This person is a human being and you want to treat them in a way that's consistently with your company's values.

The final thing you want to do is prepare a script, bullet points of what you're going to say, because firing somebody is nerve wracking. Assuming you're firing somebody for the first time, you want to walk in without worrying about forgetting what you were going to say. You can read up [on other folks' approach on firing](https://venturegeneratedcontent.com/2018/01/16/how-to-fire-an-employee-the-right-way/) to get a sense of different ways of doing things...

Set up the meeting in advance, ideally toward the end of the day to avoid creating a long, awkward moment at work for everybody afterward. You don't want to tell the person exactly what the meeting is about. Plan to bring somebody with you, probably someone from HR, to offer a bit of formality and help you focus on delivering the message.

Try to minimize the pain for the person you are firing by being quick and leaving out your own emotions. Oftentimes, it's tempting to tell people, "This is so difficult for me." Don't do that. This is about _them_ and you're trying to minimize their pain, not yours.

You might be tempted into a back-and-forth exchange. They might ask, "Is there anything I could have done? Could you change your mind?" This is not the time for back and forth. Ideally, you're handing over paperwork and leaving them a minute to react privately. And then you're giving them some instructions for any stuff they have to leave behind, and then they go.

Most of the time, people kind of know it's coming. Most of the time, people handle it like professionals. If they want to get into an argument, make it clear that you've made the decision and it isn't up for discussion. They don't have a choice; it's not a disagreement. If they think it was unfair, they're entitled to their perspective.

Firing someone sounds a lot harder than it is. Ideally, you have somebody to prepare you for it, and it's okay if you do it imperfectly — better to do it imperfectly than to keep someone subpar on your team.

#### [**What do I do when I feel like someone that works for me is being dishonest with me, but I can't prove it?**](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1mnGelXLEaQKX?t=29m57s)

Fire them immediately.

Tell them "I don't believe you." And when they ask why you can say, "Well, sometimes you can articulate it, sometimes you can't." Usually at that point, it's so fatal to their prospects at your company that they want to go. If you can't trust somebody you work with, especially as the CEO, it isn't about good or bad or right or wrong. It's about fit. If you do not trust somebody, then you can't work with them.

(And maybe before you literally fire them "immediately," do some self examination of why you don't trust this person. Is it because they remind you of your mother and your mother once lied to you? Is this a pattern or is it just you worried about one inconsequential statement? Assuming you've dealt with this stuff, you can address the work matter at hand. And of course ideally you've warned the person about their behavior before, so it isn't coming out of the blue.)

### Hiring

[**How do I know if talent is a diamond in the rough...or just rough?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1YqxoRLPzBXJv)

This is the era of talent, the "passion economy," and people are more empowered than ever. (At least people who have ended up fortunate to have the resources to thrive — so many others still struggle, day in and day out.)

Is talent a natural phenomenon that has to be found, or is it something that can be built – or refined? **Most people have talents, a zone of genius, and it's mostly a question of** _**timing**_**.** Are you meeting somebody who is ready to be in the zone of their talent? Is this something that they want to do now?

Ask about their next step, about their plans. Talk about their life experience, their reference points, their role models, and see if this person has a hunch already, or a willingness to take advice on what's next. Inquire about where they are in their journey and if they want to be on that specific journey in the first place.

Asking questions of talent doesn't _always_ lead to direct answers for them or for you, but your conversation might end up shaping their career or influencing a transformation. We have an innate fear of making our own dreams come true, and sometimes we just need someone to validate – or raise – our personal aspirations.

Finding a dream career or role can be a long process. Sometimes people have to think about how they can iterate. How can they move to a more crystallized version of their best self?

Encourage people that they can push themselves, but also recognize that they're going to have their own inner psychological barriers. Part of your role is to be a sounding board for them as they evolve through that.

_****_[**How do I know if I need an executive assistant?** ](https://www.pscp.tv/w/cbqi6DFsWktwWXhYSnhvam58MUx5eEJhdk1BUE1KTvbv50I5sKksTI1B9KjK2vEf9-7dOu2Cn2cO2Egeo4Rk)****

Think about the least useful thing you do in your day. If you find yourself doing that same task multiple times a week, find a way to take it away from you. (Is it scheduling?) You can try automating it (for example, using a filter in your email, for example). Then try delegating it to someone — maybe at first you can use a virtual assistant. If you end up having enough volume, the right answer may be to [find a full-time dedicated person to assist you](https://medium.com/newco/who-should-a-startup-hire-first-c12b279814aa).

Oftentimes the best first hire for many startups, particularly ones that have intense customer demands, is an administrative assistant to handle scheduling. You can start with a virtual assistant if you want to reduce the culture-fit risk with your company. You can graduate to a full-time person later.

****[**Why am I spending so much time interviewing people without hiring them?**](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1nAKEdpLMPoxL)****

Let's say you're spending six to eight hours a day interviewing candidates, six to eight candidates, and not hiring any. Figuring out what's broken is hard: it could mean that you're interviewing people perfectly and it's just a very high priority for you to find talent. Great CEOs can have phases in a company's life where they spend more than half their time recruiting. Or maybe you're terrible at interviewing people. Or maybe you're spending too much time interviewing — possibly by interviewing too many people — and you should set up your whole hiring system differently. (Experimentation may help. Some companies [hire without looking at resumes](https://www.fastcompany.com/1784737/silicon-valleys-new-hiring-strategy).)

It is a known fact that we are terrible at interviewing people. All this obsession over different interview styles, and what's the magic question, is probably misguided. There's research that suggests [we form our first impression within 6 seconds of meeting a person](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a920/32341de4ca3d1551095c86506af7b54150f4.pdf).

There are more useful, less time consuming ways to assess a candidate, than doing an interview. [Backdoor references done quickly before you interview are often a better source of information than interviews](https://also.roybahat.com/hiring-someone-check-references-before-you-interview-ba05c5b46e37), because the person you are asking has actually worked with the candidate — and they take less time than an interview. You might save yourself the trouble of interviewing someone whose prior coworkers despise them. Before a first interview, you could send a handful of one-line emails to people who have worked with the candidate (find them on LinkedIn). "Hey, I see you worked with \[the candidate]. [On a scale from one to 10, if you don't mind me asking, would you hire them](https://www.vox.com/2015/5/22/8639717/reid-hoffman-the-alliance)?" Whether this is appropriate or not depends on whether that person is still employed at a company, and the culture of the industry and place where you work.

Ask yourself: how do you get more leverage out of the choice of which people you interview? (Sourcing.) If your model for sourcing is "let me articulate the profile of the person I want and then find close matches for that," you're probably doing it wrong. Most of the best people in most jobs would not have passed that profile-matching test.

The third thing: interviews can be short. "I often know in the first five minutes, and then what do I do?" You can't be rude to the candidate, because the candidate impression is part of your reputation — and it's just not right. You could say something like, "I'm running really busy today, but I'd love to talk to you quick. Can we just talk for a minute and say, hi?" (That's easier on the phone or video chat.) If it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out. If it does work out, you could talk for an hour and then think how you'll flatter the candidate. Just remember when it's the one, you'll be begging. So you might as well start begging even if it's short.

An important note: interviewing is a pernicious entry place where bias enters into hiring, and can curtail diversity and inclusion and equity efforts. You want to have good candidates. The more objective you can be, the better. If you can't find backdoor references... that's _non_-data, not bad data. You can bias up on interviewing candidates from underrepresented backgrounds — because they may have had to go through more to get there, and they likely to be better talent having gotten there, they may be better talent. If you want the best talent, interview more people from underrepresented backgrounds.

****[**I'm hiring someone and unsure what to pay them. How much should I pay?**](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1eaKbzdkXmYKX)****

As a matter of principle, you want to pay everybody fairly. That means that you would be happy if you were in their shoes, getting paid what you're offering them, knowing what you know. If their happiness depends on their lack of knowledge, you're probably making a mistake.

You also want to pay them justly. (Most companies have awful behavior, for example, when it comes to paying women and men fairly — not to mention people from many other discriminated-against backgrounds. You don't want to be that person. You want to be the person who pays people justly and fairly.)

Your organization may have some pay strategy, which could guide your approach. If you're the head of the organization, you can set it. Some places intentionally say, "We pay top of market." (Netflix is known for that.) Other places pay bottom of market because they believe they "compensate" their people in other ways.

When you are in the process of getting to know a candidate, consider asking, in the very first conversation, what they need to make. You always want to front load the riskiest parts of the conversation, to make sure you're on the same page. What a tragedy if somebody goes through nine rounds of interviews, and then at the end, "Oh, crap. We can't pay you what you need to make." (There is law about this in some places, where you cannot ask what a person currently earns.) The candidate might hem and haw, but you never have more leverage than you do at the beginning of the process, when they might want the role. At least you'll get some information. And at that early point, you're not trying to negotiate the salary — just making sure you're in the same city.

To figure out what to pay them: What are they worth to you? What is the value they will bring to your organization? Some roles are easier to quantify than others. If they're a salesperson, it might be quite easy to quantify. And figure out what your next best alternative might cost. If the candidate said no, or you couldn't hire them, who would you go to next? Look at comparables — it's out there on the internet for lots of roles. Then you have a sense of what's fair.

[**Should hiring decisions be unanimous?**](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1mnGelXLEaQKX?t=24m13s)

Choosing whether to make hiring decisions unanimous should depend on the cost of being wrong. For example, when making a hiring decision for the ninth person to join your 90-person sales team, unanimity doesn't feel necessary.

\[Ed.: On the Bloomberg Beta team, hiring is unanimous. There's always a decisionmaker, but all of us has to be at least enthusiastic about the person. All of us will meet the person because it's such a small team and we all work closely together. If one person ends up not being excited to work with a person, then it just doesn't work.]

Unanimity may make for a more uniform pool of people who everybody likes, and you have to be careful not to just end up with a "least common denominator" hire. You have to compensate for that by talking a lot about how the diversity of perspectives and backgrounds that you want. So there isn't a right answer to unanimity, but the principle is to take into account the cost of being wrong.

[**Our company has never sponsored anyone for a visa in the US. Which type of visa should we pursue?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1mrxmEkkkwwxy)

For some people, there is a sense of mystery that hangs over the process of acquiring a visa. The consequential nature of the decisions you make when trying to obtain a visa might make you feel terrified or powerless, but there is no need for either of these feelings. This doesn’t serve as legal advice, but it should give you a framework for the way forward.

The approach to acquiring a visa as a founder and as an employee are different.

If you've already started a company and raised some capital and are now looking at hiring someone who is already in the US and has some visa status, you’re asking yourself, “How do I bring them to work at my company?” The short answer is you need to sponsor their visa in order to give them full-time or part-time employment. There are many types of visas, and there are many pathways to immigration, depending on your intent and the person seeking a visa. To figure out which pathway is best, ask yourself and your future employee some questions (including about their education, citizenship, professional experience), and whether they want to be in the country long-term.

Once you have the answers to these questions, select the right immigration counsel. The guidance that you find on the internet is often wrong or confusing. Working with the right experts can save you time and headaches.

Asking attorneys for advice can be frustrating as some of them may see your questions as an opportunity to sell you more legal services. A good attorney will ask you, “what are you trying to protect?” You need to find someone who will try to help you achieve your objective rather than merely do what you ask them to do.

Some of the visa categories are dependent on your company's current state. For example, you can’t apply for a J-1 when you've only just started a company; however, you can apply for an H-1B, even if you started the company only three days ago (it's about how much money you've raised). With this in mind, find someone who is going to use all of the information you provide for your specific situation. (Remember not every immigration attorney is a good _start-up_ immigration attorney.) Many attorneys specialize in high-volume cases — as a startup founder, what you want is someone who's going to look at the specifics and figure out which type of playbook is best for you.

How do you know if you have a good immigration lawyer, and how do you find one?

A worthwhile lawyer will be creative and ask questions like, "Do you know everything about this person? Do you know what their marital status is? Do you know if they have any family background in the US or if they are the first in their family to come to the US?"

It’s easy to think of H-1B by default, as this is the poster child of work visas. In reality, H-1B is just one of the 25 or more different visa pathways, which is why it's important to work with the right partners' counsel. Choosing an immigration lawyer for your company can be almost as important as choosing the right investor for your company, as an immigration attorney could cause you to gain or lose key talent that could make a difference for your business.

Although every case is different, it’s good to have a general idea of how long the process will take, how much it will cost and how certain it is.

You can expect it to take about a month, at least, to process somebody's visa. Some visas allow people to start working on them as soon as you file the petition. If you file a petition for a person who is already working on an H-1B visa, they can join you immediately; you don’t have to wait. However, in most cases, the other visa categories have an approval criterion, where until they're approved, they can't work. So, as an employer, you should factor this into your calculation.

Many founders wonder if they can even found a company when on a visa, or if they should rather wait. The biggest cost of being on a visa as a founder is waiting and delaying when you start your company. Rather than simply waiting, consider going out and seeking out partners who are going to provide you with the resources that you need. If you think you have something that you want to start today, you should start today.

Immigration plays a particularly critical role in the startup ecosystem. Going through the process of acquiring a visa can be a stressful venture, but it is well worth it in the end as long as you protect yourself and seek information from the right sources.

### How to manage people

[**How do I retain a high performer on my team?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1lDGLyopePQJm)

If you have a mentality that you **must** keep a high performer – or a person with a rare skill – at all costs, you will make bad choices or have strange dynamics on your team.

Make sure you have a plan if anybody on your team leaves, including if they have to leave because of a family illness or the like. This will give you alternatives _and_ an ability to think less emotionally, more rationally, about it.

Once you have a plan in place, think about this person on your team as engaging in a "tour of duty" at your company, as [Reid Hoffman has called it](https://hbr.org/2013/06/tours-of-duty-the-new-employer-employee-compact). You can both provide each other immense value for a period, but eventually they will move on. There's no static answer that works for a person forever.

And sometimes an amazing person will get an incredible offer that they can't refuse. \[Ed.: One of the hard things about Silicon Valley, which took me awhile to learn, is you can't rely on loyalty as a reason why people will stay.]

So when you're interviewing someone, ask, "What do you hope to get out of the next phase of your career?" And have a real dialogue with them about it. Some people want to have a new experience or get a badge for something to show the world what they've accomplished.

Ask yourself, "How can I make working with me, right now, the very best way in the world that this person can accomplish their goal?" And then design a role and situation that is bespoke for that need. And ideally, it's something that serves your needs as a company, but you might have to take some risks. You might need to give them more responsibility than they wanted.

And you need to understand what motivates your employee, whether it is exposure to other teams or projects, visibility, recognition, etc. And work with them to fulfill those motivations and collaborate with you on what a successful tour of duty looks like.

\[Ed.: I've had cases where a high performer worked for me and I introduced them to others for interviews. My philosophy is you should be talking with others all the time, unless you're in a closed industry where talking to them might explode your reputation. You need to know what your options are and it's a continuous process.]

The answer to "How do I keep a high performer?" is similar as "How do I attract a high performer?" because keeping them is a constant process of drawing them to the challenges that you have to offer in your workplace.

Success for your team member means they are performing at their best, they feel like their needs are satisfied, and they remain for some period of time. And then you have to reinvent and do it constantly. Be in a service leader mentality, deeply trying to understand what that person believes they want and figuring out how best to give it to them.

[**How do I know if I have set unrealistic expectations for my team?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1LyxBaAXnDOJN)

Snowflake didn't get to be [worth $60 billion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/09/29/snowflake-looks-like-a-risky-bet-at-a-60-billion-plus-valuation/#26d98e75f406) by sequencing one reasonable expectation after another. And yet, everyone has had experiences where someone asked you to do more than what was possible.

[Bernard Shaw said](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/536961-the-reasonable-man-adapts-himself-to-the-world-the-unreasonable), “The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man" \[or woman or non-binary person].

In essence this is true: most people worry too much about being realistic and not enough about progress. But as with many things, you have to think about timing and dosage.

Think about how you would answer the question, "How do I know if I've spoken too loudly in a meeting?" You would look for cues from your environment and practice – and you can use the same approach here.

Make yourself slightly uncomfortable by pushing a little harder with your expectations and see if it works. And if it works, build on it. Ultimately, if you've set expectations that are too hard, something will have to give – the confidence of the team, their sanity, or you'll have to invent your way out.

Kieran Snyder, CEO of Textio (in which Bloomberg Beta is a proud investor), has [shared](https://twitter.com/KieranSnyder/status/1308128961730236416) the importance of setting working models for managing up, down, and over, to achieve your main accountability as a manager: Delivering high-impact work on time and growing people in the process. Think about what your direct reports expect and what they are capable of.

You have to will it to happen _and_ have the skill and practice to make it happen. Often the people with the least realistic expectations are the most experienced people, and they know exactly what they're pushing for and whether it's okay or not okay. If you missed the number this quarter, is everything going to fall apart or not?

Practice being unreasonable because it's a (useful) skill.

[**How can I get someone to change by giving them feedback?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1LyGBaZVrNjKN)

There's an overly simplistic idea many people believe about how to work with others: if you just tell a person what they're doing wrong or what you would like them to do, they'll change! That's rarely, if ever, how it works.

Some people then think if only they get a bigger title, then people will listen to them. The reality: the relationship between peers and the relationship between a boss and somebody who works for them are often more similar than different. \[Ed.: One of my favorite compliments I ever received was when a friend who overheard me on a conference call said, "I don't know if you were talking to somebody you work for... or somebody who works for you."]

If you actually want somebody to change, the first thing to do is to **try to understand them**. How do they think about things? What do they want? Who do they see themselves as? If you can connect your desire for their change to something that they want, then they can change. **People change for their reasons, not your reasons.** \[Ed.: Something I learned from [my coach](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carole-robin-a8b5a91/).]

**Get permission to give feedback.** Like a vampire entering the house, you need an invitation to enter.

**Give feedback — and focus, entirely if possible, on positive feedback when they move in the direction you want.** Think about [the animal trainer model](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/style/modern-love-what-shamu-taught-me-happy-marriage.html), rewarding people when they do what you want. The reward can be small — a thank you in Slack, or a thumbs up text. \[Ed.: We use [Bonusly](https://bonus.ly), in which we're proud investors, for continuous encouragement of our own team at [Bloomberg Beta](http://bloombergbeta.com).]

**Give that positive feedback consistently and as often as possible.** If the behavior is negative (i.e., not what you want), ignore it unless it's too material to be quiet — e.g., it violates your values or it's catastrophic. Try to frame everything as a positive, where possible.

It's helpful to offer alternatives ("What if we tried doing it this other way?") and point to positive examples as much as possible.

Be mindful of the other person's "learning language," i.e., what is their best way to receive information. Some people like concrete examples, others learn visually, some like conversation and others prefer written communication. Experiment and be aware of how your feedback lands.

**Every so often to really get people to change, you need to exercise power.** Sometimes the big stick of the bosses watching can matter, but it's rare.

And what if you want not just a person to change, but a work product to change? In this case, sometimes you just have to change the work product yourself or ask for the specific change you want.

**It's hard to say, ultimately, how much people really can change.** People do grow and evolve, though oftentimes our sadness at work stems from our expectation that somebody might evolve — when really we need to find another solution. This is why understanding people is so important, because people can't always be changed through the magic of your word.

[**What do I do when I'm worried someone who works for me should be working harder?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1RDxlrREDYkGL)

Hard work is a virtue, but it means different things to different people. For some, it means intensity and how much you care about the work that you do. For others, it literally means how many hours you're clocking. We all ought to care more about outputs (what someone makes happen) than the inputs (how many hours they work).

Sometimes we don't know what to expect of a person in a role, and you can't help but think, "shouldn't we all be giving it our all?" Some companies have cultures where you feel you need "face time," where you're supposed to stay late because you want others to believe you're working hard (or at least available to work hard) — this is common in professional services, like law or investment banking. In some companies, particularly in early-stage startups, the pressure to work long hours can be part of _esprit de corps_ — we're all doing it together. Acknowledge the environment and the conditions that you're working around and ask yourself if they work. **Stop and figure out** _**why**_ **you want this person to work differently, and oftentimes you'll recognize that the issue is yours, not theirs.**

\[Ed.: I remember one of the first executives I ever hired, who every Friday at around 4 or 4:30 would leave to go surfing. I'd get so frustrated; we'd be trying to finish something important and here I am, the CEO, stuck at the office. He ignored me on the issue and, as much as I was bothered, eventually I had to suck it up. He was a great performer, and I think I would have been better off not getting frustrated and just saying, "have fun surfing."]

If you do find you want somebody to pick up their intensity or care or hours, for then go back to the "[animal trainer](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/style/modern-love-what-shamu-taught-me-happy-marriage.html)" model of congratulating them when they move in the direction you want.

Sometimes you have to diagnose the situation first. Get curious, saying "Hey, I have noticed that you have been working fewer hours than others," (stick to the facts, not your characterization). You never know when there's something temporary going on for someone, like an issue in their family, and they may open up. Then explain the effect on you of how they work. Once they see that their actions have an effect on you (and others, if you lead the team and want to speak for others), they might change.

Ultimately this is a behavior that's often impossible to change, so don't waste too much time letting the person try to prove it. If it's not going to work, sometimes it's not going to work.

Avoid: (1) Requests that are clearly just for "optics," for how hard someone _appears_ to be working without getting anything done. For example, saying, "Hey, the boss comes by everyday at nine and I want to see you there." (2) Getting passive aggressive, a common thing many managers do. Start out with yourself and figure out why, then everything will follow from there.

[**What do I do with employees who overvalue themselves?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1eaJbzAXqqXJX)

"Overvaluing" can mean many things: a person's ego being too big, them wanting to be involved in choices that you don't think they need to be involved, or wanting more money than you think they're worth, or a bigger title or public profile. (This frequently happens with early startup employees who were in on everything at the beginning, but then the company grows and circumstances change.)

The solution depends on which kind of overvaluing you are solving.

If the issue is around ego, unpack the "story" from the behavior: sometimes the fact they privately overvalue themselves is not a problem, even if it bugs you. Solve for the behavior. If they overvalue themselves on money, you might need to say, "You know what? We need to fire this person, we're paying them too much." If they overvalue themselves on decision-making, you might need to have an honest talk and say, "You can't be in all these decisions anymore." And if it works out, it works out, and if it doesn't, it doesn't. But overvaluing is not one problem, it's many.

### Reviewing performance

****[**What is a 360 review and how do I conduct one?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/cY20DDFsWktwWXhYSnhvam58MXlvS01hV3liUGRLUW7n8moaoREHEEJkpMfSNJrLnw0y7X6qnde6lAnu81DD)****

A 360 (degree) review is a tool for capturing feedback where the source of the feedback can include people inside and outside the organization — in other words, unlike a traditional review (just the boss) or a 180 review (just the peers and those who work for the person being reviewed).

To administer a 360 review, some companies hire a vendor, or an outside consultant to do it, so that reviewers know it's not somebody in the company. If it's a small company, it might need to be the person themselves receiving it — ideally it's somebody else.

A 360 review starts with a set a list of reviewers. If it's the CEO being reviewed, that last can include everybody in the company. If it's a person who leads a team, it might be their team and peers in the organization.

And then you collect feedback from this list of reviewers: First, you communicate to the reviewers why you're doing a 360 review. Maybe it's because the person being reviewed wants to grow as a leader. (That's why you might do a 360 review on yourself.) Maybe it's about the fact that the company values open communication.

Usually the reviewers give feedback anonymously. This is always tricky because reviewers may fear that the recipient could read between the lines, or maybe the reviewers don't trust the process fear the administrators might accidentally reveal who they are. Handle that with care.

One simple method is for the reviewers to complete a simple form. Here's one [reference example of a 360 review form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1\_WsCxCac2sHxmI6yzIJnruNHg5geeTzWGsAQdfnJvBA/edit). It might have as few as two questions. One question might be, on a scale from one to ten, how highly would you recommend working with this person? (The [Net Promoter Score](https://www.netpromoter.com/know/)-type question, which allows you to loosely benchmark whether the answers are "good" or "bad.") And then the second question might be... why? An open paragraph for feedback, inviting more commentary, can give the person administering the review grist for the mill of writing the summarized review.

You can find more elaborate versions of a 360 review: Sometimes reviewers complete 15-page forms that score the recipient on 92 categories. (Editor: I've never really found those particularly helpful.)

The manager of the person being reviewed usually presents the feedback, though sometimes the administrator of the 360 review presents it. The 360 review can be part of an official performance review, or a separate process. Organizations use 360 reviews both for driving professional growth and/or for evaluation.

Some recipients share their 360 reviews with their teams, or with the organization as a whole. This demonstrates that the reviewers' input didn't end up in a black hole, and can encourage future feedback because reviewers see the response to their feedback. Many reviewers appreciate hearing when the next 360 review will take place (annually?), to create a sense of continuity.

[**What do I do when a junior employee comes to me with critical feedback about a more senior employee, and asks me to keep it confidential?**](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1mnGelXLEaQKX?t=28m53s)

If you're the boss of both people, then this is straightforward: you can treat this information as input (assuming nobody broke a law or something like that). When you do a "180 review" or a "360 review," you collect input from lots of people and synthesize it and present it to the person as their manager. Think of this as a one-off instance of that.

In the meantime, try to encourage the person to go deliver the feedback themselves and talk them through how to do it. The person delivering the feedback should feel empowered and not feel like they need you to be a conduit.
