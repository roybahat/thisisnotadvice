# Working with others

### Email

In many industries, the main way you communicate with people at work -- co-workers, partners, anyone -- is email. So while it's great to understand "workplace communication," arguably it's most important to understand email -- [Elon does](https://www.quora.com/What-makes-Elon-Musk-so-good-at-email-communication).

#### [What do I do if someone I reach out to doesn't respond to my email?](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1kvJpXvlqNVJE)

Frustrating! You spend your time crafting a message carefully. Maybe it's a cold email, or maybe it's somebody you've known really well. And then, the response never arrives.

Why, though? You don't really know. Are they unresponsive because it went to spam, are they unresponsive because they're working on it, are they unresponsive because they want to ignore you? Avoid assuming any specific reason for the response, because you just don't know. You don't know if somebody in their family died. You don't know if they're ignoring you. You don't know if it went to the promotions tab.

Context matters. If it's somebody you email all the time, and they're usually back in an hour, and it's important that's really different than a stranger.

That said, for a normal context, like a founder pitching an investor, expecting a response within 24 hours (if it's not a cold email) is reasonable.

A frequent situation that comes up is you're following up with an investor, going back and forth over email, and then they go dark. What people normally do is a bad idea: is they send like a dot, dot, dot, ping, like, "Hey, knock knock, what's the latest? That's just annoying. Sometimes when the person receives that reminder, it's fine because the recipient thinks, "Oh my gosh, I totally missed her email."&#x20;

What you could do: write to them, forwarding the same thread. (Or, if you're worried the thread got buried, change the subject line.) Say something unrelated to what you were writing about, and still important for them to know. So, for example, say you're a founder and you've been talking to an investor and you sent them a follow on with your financial model, or something. And then, they go dark. Consider sending them, intermittently, good news about things that happened with the company without explicitly following up. "Hey, just want to let you know, our customer just told us we're moving to the contract stage." And that way when you show back up in their inbox, it's good news when they look at it. That response is "robust" to being appropriate across a wide range of circumstances. (It may also make them feel like the opportunity is slipping away!)

This assumes you were being tactful about what you were asking in the original note, and then can reiterate that concisely without being rude. \[MK] People rarely get shamed into responding to emails. "Shorter and funnier," in general, is a good rule of thumb in life, including on email.&#x20;

#### [Should I write one long, complex email or break it up into a few short ones?](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1kvJpXvlqNVJE)

If you have multiple asks of the recipient, sometimes the better thing to do is break up one long email into separate ones. "Each email is an action."

This depends, again, on context. For some emailers, email is a "command line" -- they want everything to be a sentence long and just act on it. This is common among traders. There are other professional cultures where all emails are basically electronic letters. They say, "Dear Roy," they have paragraphs, they go on and on, blah, blah, blah. And, in that context, it's appropriate to include multiple asks in the same email.

[**In arranging a meeting, when is it OK to send someone a scheduling link like Calendly instead of proposing times or connecting them with an administrative assistant?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1djxXorXEOEJZ)

Think about the person to whom you’re sending a link, how they might feel about it, and whether their convenience is more important to you than your own.

Although some people might appreciate getting a scheduling link, others will see it as an inconvenience (although few people will admit to hating Calendly, Doodle, or Mixmax links when asked). \[Ed.: when I receive a Calendly link, I'm fortunate because I have administrative support. If I didn’t have the assistance, I think dealing with Calendly would be a lot more difficult.]

When deciding to send a Calendly link, consider why you're sending it. If you are solving for your own convenience, then Calendly is magnificent. If you're solving for the convenience of the other person, then it depends on how the receiver will interpret it. If the person to whom you're sending the link is somebody who is familiar with these types of tools and you get a sense that they're tech savvy, then they would probably appreciate the Calendly link. Many people in the working world may not be as knowledgeable about tools like Calendly and, for them, navigating an unfamiliar tool may be a burden. If the relationship is important to you, and you don’t know the person well, you may not want to ask them to do work by clicking through to some tool.

Post-Covid, the acceptance of tools like Calendly may have changed. More people are online and trying to find time. Many more people might feel scheduling tools save them time, and that they are faster than having to email back and forth."

If you just aren’t sure how someone will perceive the Calendly link, you can always give them the option to use it or not. You could say, “Would you be free next Tuesday at three? If that doesn't work for you, let me know when it might, or if you prefer, you can just click here.”

If you’re solving for your own convenience, sending a Calendly link is a great option. If you want to solve for the convenience of others, you may want to consider giving them the option to use Calendly or a more traditional method.

### Building relationships

#### [What do I do in my first day at a new job?](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1nAKEdaXzQoxL)

You show up at a job and think, "What do I do now?" Many people secretly struggle with this, thinking, "I think I should probably be busier on my first day, but I don't really know what to do at my new job, and I don't know who to talk to about what... so what do I do now?"&#x20;

It helps to have something to do on that first day.

Here is a default you can use: on the first day at a new job, learn as much as you possibly can, demonstrate you are learning. Try to be of use to as many people as possible.&#x20;

For example: Read all of the company's internal documentation . Think, "What are the things that once I get really busy, I'll wish I had taken time to learn?" Few people take the time to do that.

Figure out all the people with whom you might need to work and show up, to them, in a useful way. Knock, knock: "It's my first day, and I know you run this area of operations on which I would depend. I'd love to learn about your job. I'd love to do it without taking too much of your time. Can you tell me more about what you do?" You'd be surprised how many people are thrilled to open up to you in the beginning, because that's their chance to program you. And allow yourself to be programmed, at least a little bit.

Don't be the hero on the first day, accomplishing some Great Feat. Your job is to play for the long term, figure out how to be useful.

#### [As a person who is not black or an underrepresented minority, how do I come to work and talk to my colleagues about race?](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1YqxoQolVYvGv)

\[Ed.: I am a white, straight man who now has money. I live in the most prosperous country on Earth at the most prosperous period in human history. And I've benefited from so much privilege. And every work culture is different, so I can only speak to the ones that I know. I myself am really still a learner on this.] If we're willing to talk as an organization about a natural disaster like a fire in Australia, we need to be able to talk about this.

In general, you never know what's going to be emotional for other people. That said, it should not be the responsibility of a person of color to bring up difficult issues around race. Those of us with power or who are in positions of privilege, we have to bring it up respectfully and skillfully and thoughtfully, either one-on-one or as a team. If you are in a position of privilege, to offer support, whether it's mental health or economic or wellness or anything like that, do.

Start by acknowledging when you don't know what somebody else feels. It gives others room to tell me if they want, and to names my own limitations. For many people there's a pain that's with them all the time. It's never just about whatever immediate moment prompts the conversation, it's about that and a long history that came before.

The other important thing: it isn't about you. This is about the community that is in pain. This is about directing energy into supporting them and not putting additional work on those communities.

Put in the work of learning. Read the books. Learn the history, learn what's happening now. Do the work before you ask. In many situations people ask a person of color about some aspect of history or what they mean by something. It isn't fair to ask others who are already going through so much. We've got to avoid putting more weight on black and brown shoulders.

Avoid asking for the cookie, being patted on the head for doing your job as an ally. And by the same token, if somebody complains that you're not doing it right, try to avoid defending yourself.&#x20;

Once you've been learning, or as you're learning, give. Give to somebody you work with by caring for them and reaching out. Give money if you can, to organizations that are fighting the fight. Give time.

You will probably make mistakes. You're coping with your own feelings. It's great to have feelings right now, and always. Remember, that it may be about somebody else's feelings more than it's about yours. Channel those feelings into action and to doing the right thing.&#x20;

#### [As a white person specifically, how do I talk to white colleagues about race?](https://twitter.com/roybahat/status/1281013616464912384)

It starts with just that question -- choosing to bring it up. That's an important step, especially if you're in a position of power where you can set the tone. It's OK to recognize that you've messed up a few times -- you may create space for others to share their own mistakes. Nobody knows how to do these conversations "correctly" yet. You can start by educating yourself -- there are great resources out there, like [Robin DiAngelo's work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45ey4jgoxeU).

Forget planning a canned speech. Instead, focus on building understanding and empathy with you. Perhaps some older people grew up with a different way of viewing race, try to understand how they see the world before making any arguments.&#x20;

Chastising people, at least in a collegial work setting, basically never works. Imagine the white person you're speaking to is an animal at the circus. [How do you get an animal at the circus to change?](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/style/modern-love-what-shamu-taught-me-happy-marriage.html) When they move in the right direction, you encourage them, reward them. When they go in the wrong direction, you provide nothing, ignore them. The difference in discussions about race is that sometimes silence is consent, and you may feel compelled to speak truth to power. When you do that, try to do it in a way that stops that immediate harm. After stopping immediate harm,  avoid shaming or even convincing -- instead, consider seeing your goal as getting the other person to a place where they can listen.

White people sometimes say, "Well, I've struggled in my life. I grew up poor. I didn't have privilege." Honor their struggle, say, "Yeah, I know you went through a lot -- and still you benefited from privilege." Avoid discounting their experience -- that might repel them from opening up.

\[Ed.: I myself went through this journey, going from rejecting the idea of being privileged to seeing it more fully. I am the child of immigrants who came to the U.S. with almost nothing. My father died when I was 12. I worked very, very hard -- sometimes damaging myself in the process of all that intensity, throwing elbows, and sleepless nights. So it was hard for me to see my own privilege. Now I see that I was white, male, with parents who loved me, educated in the most fertile soil. I had many forms of privilege.]

Other white people say, "I'm colorblind. I don't see race." This view discounts the fact that there is a different experience that has been lived and is lived every day by people of color, by Black people. And so to say, "I'm just a meritocratic person," can become an excuse for ignoring the suffering and reality of daily injustice. Of course Black communities have many perspectives, one perspective (from financier Mellody Hobson is to [be color "brave" instead of colorblind](https://blog.ted.com/be-color-brave-not-color-blind-mellody-hobson-at-ted2014/).

Yet more white people will say, "It's not really _that_ bad a problem. The numbers aren't as bad as you think," or, "Confederate flags are part of Southern history so maybe they should be allowed." Consider getting at this by being personal. If someone who says this is Jewish, you could say, "The swastika is part of German history. Would you be okay with a swastika flag flying somewhere? No, because it's a symbol of an ideology that included hate."

In general, these conversations are so hard, they're chances to practice nonviolent communication. Two lines on that, that I've heard from mentors of mine are "connect before you correct," and "curious before furious." \[Ed.: I try to practice these, though I'm not always successful.]

When you're in other conversations, about subjects other than race, you can also move things forward. If somebody asks you for a book recommendation, unrelated to anything about race, consider recommending a Black author. If someone asks you for a referral for a job, unrelated to anything about race, send them a Black candidate.&#x20;

\[Ed.: A coach of mine, who is Black, underlined the catastrophe when he asked me to imagine that, instead of that cop's knee on George Floyd's neck, that it had been him. I stopped and thought. It moved me to think differently about all this. Imagining it as personal, because for others it _is_ personal, feels essential to me.]

Being an ally is hard, it's risky, it takes work -- you will have setbacks and need to overcome them. It's nowhere near as tough as being a person of color, especially being Black in America.

### Convincing others

[**How do I send a cold ask to someone prominent and get them to respond?** ](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1PlKQNVnraNGE?t=12m35s)****

****[Tristan Walker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tristanwalker/) is a great entrepreneur, the founder of [Walker & Company](https://walkerandcompany.com/) (acquired by Procter & Gamble in 2018), and currently on the board of Foot Locker and Shake Shack. In 2009, he wanted to work at Foursquare -- everyone wanted to work there. He applied on the company website and didn't hear anything back. He sent emails, he didn't hear anything back. So he emailed again, and again, and again, and again. It still didn't work.&#x20;

When Tristan didn't hear back from Foursquare, he decided to just start doing work for them on the side, and reached out to brands saying, "Hey, would you want to run ads on Foursquare?" He got creative about how to deliver value -- and this early-stage company took note and ended up hiring him.&#x20;

If someone isn't responsive to you, figure out a way to do something to help them. Be useful.

### Sensitive issues

****[**What does it mean to keep your word?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1jMJgXoVVjmxL)****

There are many gradations between being an outright liar and being completely reliable. Learn where to draw the line.

(In the tech industry , there's a term of art for people who don't keep their word -- they're just called "slippery." In tech, if you expect someone to keep their word, you need to be explicit about what you expect in them and what it could cost you. \[Ed.: I once had an argument with a founder who said, "You can invest up to $1 million in our company." Soon after we said, "Great. We'd like to invest $500,000." He then responded by saying, "Well, okay, let me see if I can accommodate that." He broke his promise. I called him on it, and he was upset -- I even sent him a screenshot of our earlier conversation. He'd seen it as a "soft" promise, an intention as opposed to a commitment. I imagine he felt some shame when I called him on it. In my approach, I'm extremely explicit and blunt: the benefit of my approach is that people know where I stand; the cost is that I risk alienating people. Understand the consequences of your own behavior.])

**The clearest way to keep your word: be (1) precise about what you promise, (2) adhere to it rigidly, and (3) communicate reliably about it.** Changing any of these can cause you to fail to keep your word.

One level down from this gold standard is to be imprecise in what you say, but still adhere to it rigidly and communicate reliably. Call these people the "squirmers." They stick to the letter of the agreement, but not always the spirit. \[Ed.: I remember when I was a founder, an investor wrote me and said, "We want to lead your funding round." I interpreted his note as an offer to lead the round. He said, "no, no, no, no, no, no, no... we just said we _want_ to lead your round, meaning that we want to figure it out." That's the squirm.]

Then you have people who are precise in what they say, but fail to adhere to it rigidly. Call that person a "welcher." Welchers always have a reason -- some circumstance changed. The whole point of keeping your word is it's supposed to be independent of circumstances changing.

Which raises the question: **is any welching, any slipping,  acceptable? That's a matter of the norms in your industry, and who you want to be as a person.** There are almost always immaterial things that change -- pennies of difference in an investment amount, for example. The challenge with norms is people see them differently depending on their seat and their experiences. A norm example where it's obviously okay to slip is you're playing a game, like [Werewolf](https://www.playwerewolf.co/) where you're _supposed_ to lie to other people. \[Ed.: I've experienced cases where we had an investor change after the term sheet and they said, "Well, we learned something new." But in venture, we almost always, 99.9% of the time, stick to the terms, unless something material arises that we couldn't have known beforehand.]

The next level down is the person who is precise in their speech, adheres rigidly to what they said, but is unreliable in whether they communicate. That's the "ghoster." The person who just disappears is hardest to deal with because it's difficult to figure out what happened. It's hard to get "curious before furious" with a ghoster.

**How can you tell in an ambiguous situation, whether you've kept your word?** Ask yourself, did honoring my commitment cost me? If you're constantly justifying yourself about why it was OK – then you're probably not keeping your word.&#x20;

Sometimes failing to keeping your word might _not_ have consequences. Karma is an unreliable enforcer. (That's why it's so satisfying when it does come back to bite people, or in the case of good karma to help them.) You just have to decide what kind of person you want to be.

People also change from situation to situation. Sometimes the reason somebody welches due to a thing you can't see, like a confidential commitment to someone else that they learned conflicts with their commitment to you. Often times the reason we fail to keep our word is because we're embarrassed to admit that we have other conflicting obligations; we feel we mismanaged things. Try to be upfront. Sometimes people suddenly become unreliable in communication... maybe they're going through an issue with addiction or a sick family member.

Respect for life circumstances and difference is important. And if you value relying on the other person to keep their word, then ask them, in a way that fits the situation at hand, what norms they follow -- and be explicit about yours.

[**What should I do if I broke my word?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1YqKDpwwkLOKV)****

\[Ed.: I once had promised somebody who I was talking to about a job that I would pay him as much as one of his peers, a woman in the same role. And I didn't. I honestly forgot that I had promised this to that person, and I thought I gave them what they wanted. And years later, he discovered the gap and reminded me of what I had promised. He was dignified about it and said, "Well, I thought you promised this." And honestly, I didn't remember. I'd worked with this person for so long and trusted them. As much as I try to be careful about being honest to my word, I had to acknowledge that I didn’t in this case.]

Swallow the sword. Admit you messed up. Avoid applying a coat of sugar. Just be there and let the other person recognize that you're there. And if it hurts, and you find yourself wanting to explain it away, it's okay to provide some context -- stay away from the thin line between providing that context and trying to dismiss it. You can't let yourself off the hook. So the first thing to do is acknowledge it up front.&#x20;

Then try to make it right. Usually, you should overcompensate. \[Ed.: in the case of the person who worked for me, I went on to try to pay the person as much as I possibly could after that, gave him a special bonus, etc. to get him up to the right point.]

Little examples of breaking your word happen all the time. Sometimes you say, "Hey, I'll be back to you early next week," and Wednesday comes. Well, Wednesday isn't “early next week.” Own it and then overcompensate to make it right.&#x20;

If we fail to keep our word on the little things, nobody should trust us to keep our word on the big things. Word is bond, whether it's in six-point font or 60-point font.&#x20;

****[**What do I do if I don't trust HR with a workplace issue?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1gqGvaqQRnAKB)****

\[Ed.: I've seen this from different angles: I've been an employee who has gone to HR, a CEO who oversaw HR and had employees go to HR, etc.]

There's a misconception at the heart of this question, which is that HR works for the employee -- they do not. It's confusing because HR might reach out to you and offer you resources, like information on your benefits or offers of advice. In any training about harassment, you'll hear that you should go to HR. You end up feeling like HR is on your side.

While a good HR person will certainly keep the employee's best interest at heart, **HR works for the company. HR does not work for you.** Ultimately, if you have a delicate question -- especially if your issue is with leadership and the company is small -- you can end up with tricky dilemmas.

But if you have an issue and are not sure if you could trust the HR person, how would you handle it?&#x20;

Gather evidence if you think you might need it. As we saw with Susan Fowler's [story](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber) at Uber, it helps  to have data to back your perspective.

**Start with people you trust the most, and radiate out from there.** Turn to the friends who you trust who understand your context, whether or not they work with you, ask their advice. Then consider communities of people, sometimes gathered in forums.

Before you go to HR, ask yourself if you can trust your manager or your skip-level manager and voice your concerns so they're on the lookout and can be an advocate in either tracking or raising the issue.&#x20;

(For example, [ELFA](https://www.elfaonline.org/) started a couple of years ago, born out of a women's community. It provides a rich place for conversation and feedback; you can ask your question and have people give their input and their own experiences.)

Some nonprofits will help you if you're stuck with an issue, particularly if it's around harassment or some other form of discrimination. You can text [Empower Work](https://www.empowerwork.org) to get questions answered.

Then, there are plenty of cases where what you need is a lawyer (if you can afford one), and that's a big decision to make but it's important to think about it.

Be careful about what you share with HR if you're unsure if you trust them. You're certainly under no ethical obligation to share things with people that you don't trust. **It's up to HR to earn your trust.** There is no magic to the person being in HR other than that many great HR people have a code of trying to do right by people.

Even if you escalate your issues, sometimes HR can be part of the problem. In this case, your best recourse may be to leave.

[**How do I get someone else to keep their word?** ](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1djGXoAkROeKZ)****

Before you focus on how to get somebody to honor their commitment, ask, "What did I learn from this moment? Did I learn something about this person, about doing business with them in the future?" Sometimes you learn something damning, sometimes you learn there's been a miscommunication -- what does the data tell you?

Ideally your first time relying on someone to keep their word is a low-stakes situation. Sometimes a high-stakes situation is unavoidable. Consider using the "[egg toss method](https://also.roybahat.com/the-trust-thing-691791a4c6ca)" to build trust gradually, taking bigger risks as you get to know a person.

The first step to getting a person to honor a deal, which might be surprising, is to _avoid calling them on it._ That accusation -- "we had a deal and you're breaking it" -- can bring up feelings of shame if you start off by saying. Give the person [a golden bridge to retreat across](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/53037-build-your-opponent-a-golden-bridge-to-retreat-across) -- try to make it easy for them to restore their word without admitting they were wrong.

**Figure out their reason for not keeping their word, because they almost always have a reason.** Most people do not forget their commitments. Once you understand the reason, then you can diagnose it.

\[Ed.: we had a case where a founder of a startup promised we could invest and, when another investor got involved, they asked to change the terms of the deal. They were worried that if they kept their promise to us the other investor would walk away, and they were afraid to talk to the other investor about it. Once I knew this, I was able to coach the founder to take the risk because honoring your commitments requires taking some risks.]

Once you understand the reason for someone not honoring a deal, there are two main ways to influence them: One is hard consequences. For example, saying, "We might not be willing to do business with you in the future." This type of effect can be interpreted as a threat, so you should be careful doing it because it can be a tough one to take back. But sometimes they'll be mortified and fix it. Sometimes those actual consequences won't work, especially in startup world where somebody thinks, "I'd burn this one investor, I'll probably never see them again."

Then there are moral consequences. \[Ed.: In the situation with the same founder who made us a promise he wanted to break, I said, "You might never pay a price from doing this; plenty of wildly successful people go through their careers not keeping promises. The question to ask yourself is 'what kind of person do you want to be?' Do you want to look yourself in the mirror and be the person who kept your promise or not?" Ultimately, he kept his word, and that's an example of a moral "consequence."]

It's hard to get somebody to keep their word once they've decided they're going to do something else. In general, your odds of success here are low. So you may just need to move on and hope it wasn't in a catastrophic situation.

Sometimes it's tempting when you have a point of view, especially a moral point of view, and somebody else doesn't act on it, to think of yourself as the moral authority. In business dealings, when you have two parties, there is no moral authority. It's just different people trying to reconcile different ways of looking at the world. You may think, "Hey, this person's value system is incompatible with mine." But sometimes you've got to work with them. But you are not the authority, you are just trying to figure it out, as we all are.

#### [How do I know if I can trust a new potential business partner?](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1OdJrqBLWyPGX)

You work with people all the time and some of them let you down and some of them don't.&#x20;

**So triangulate**. Look at multiple different sources of information about any person. Who introduced you? How much do you trust that person? How much do they trust them. (There's a transitive property of trust.) If the person behaved badly, would the person who introduced us be able to get them to behave better? (If so, that's a good sign.)

Where else can you find information about them on the internet? The more information there is on their LinkedIn, in things they've written, the better. Google them -- you'd be surprised how few people do that. It can be harder to find information about some people, often depending on their demographic, location, or occupation. Some communities share little in public.&#x20;

Listen to your own intuition.&#x20;

One way to figure out if you trust somebody is the [egg toss method](https://also.roybahat.com/the-trust-thing-691791a4c6ca), that game kids play, where you throw an egg and hope it doesn't break. And you get a little further, a little bit at a time. As you get to know people, give them opportunities to stab you in the back -- just little opportunities. If the egg falls on the first toss, it's no big deal. By the time you're in business together, [especially if they're an investor in your company](https://app.gitbook.com/@bloomberg-beta-1/s/this-is-not-advice-about-work/startups#how-do-i-know-if-an-angel-investor-is-a-legitimate-candidate-to-invest-or-just-pulling-a-bait-and-switch), it could be much worse.

[**Should I mentor someone? And if so, how do I do it?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1mrGmEjPpDkGy)****

There are often things you can do for someone more valuable than mentorship -- "[make the hire, send the wire](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-technology-202/2020/06/09/the-technology-202-black-venture-capitalists-say-it-s-time-for-silicon-valley-make-good-on-its-promises-with-action/5ede7b75602ff12947e874b0/)."\
\
When you do want to mentor, it should be about genuine connection and learning from one another. Most good mentorship relationships are glued together by people doing real work together. For example, one person hired the other person, or invested in their company. Oftentimes there's a pretext before mentoring that makes the relationship more valuable.

One mistake people can make is looking for a mentor or mentee for the sake of it. Mentorship is not about a phony title or a superiority-inferiority relationship, it's about real learning and helping one another succeed.&#x20;

Think about why you want a mentee and what you want to accomplish. Maybe they could benefit from having multiple mentors if they want to cover different areas – perhaps even folks from different life or career stages. \[Ed.: My wife says you should have a mentor in every decade of _their_ life, so one mentor in their 20's, another in their 30's, one in their 70's, etc.]

As a mentor, it's helpful to take your cues from the other person about what they want, because like with many relationships, it works best when it's pulled and not pushed. This approach can help you figure out whether a mentor relationship really makes sense to pursue – and how intensive it may be – and gauge whether you can be useful to them.

To understand what another person wants out of mentorship and the current phase of their work life, you can ask questions like "[When you think about the next phase of your career, what do you want to get out of it](https://also.roybahat.com/would-you-like-career-advice-ac8314f2ea8f)?" Once you understand what they really want, then you can cast yourself in a supporting role.

In a mentorship role, it's often more useful to give your observations and guesses -- as opposed to telling the other person what they _should_ do. Even the experts are mostly wrong. And it's their life, after all. (Remember the theme of this whole work -- this is not advice.) It's about them, not about you.

Once you've decided to become a mentor, set expectations and a cadence. It might be daily. It could be a twice-a-year conversation. Being clear about that up front can often help guide how you want to build that relationship. When you get to know someone more closely, this often becomes more organic.

Mentorship can bring great joy and fulfillment. It's incredible to watch others achieve -- and you might get a richer personal and professional experience along the way.

#### [How do I say no, without offending, when someone asks for something?](https://twitter.com/roybahat/status/1278484076756733952) For example, a meeting, coffee during which they can "pick your brain," etc.

As you advance professionally, more and more people will look to you. The corollary: more requests for your time.

Declining requests can feel awkward. Perhaps you consider yourself someone who wants to help others. Accepting a request and helping people is nice. It feels good.&#x20;

**Start with noticing you have the ability to choose:** you are not required to say yes to someone wanting to, e.g., "pick your brain." When someone is asking, they are asking to extract valuable knowledge. The value of your knowledge and, therefore, your time is enough of a reason to decline a meeting request. Without being conscious of your value, careers can stall, as you end up in meeting after meeting which extract, as opposed to deliver, value.

You could try another strategy which is to default no to all meetings. Think to yourself "every single meeting request should get a no" because your time is precious.&#x20;

**Once you've decided to say no, how do you do it?**

First, make sure they actually need the time they are requesting. For example, a founder might ask, "Can we have a call, so I can give you an update on us? Then maybe you can introduce us to some investors." You might respond, "I could just give you the introductions?" More likely than not, the reply will be "Yeah, I just want the one introduction." Sometimes by probing a little what someone wants, you can give them what they want, in a different way than they expected, without spending the time.&#x20;

If you find yourself giving repetitive advice, one principle to follow is a software principle, which is [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't\_repeat\_yourself): don't repeat yourself. Instead of answering the same question over and over again, consider writing a blog piece.

When you say no, _it can help to explain why you're refusing the request_. Refer to the principle, or the goal that the requester can easily understand: "I'd love to speak, I'm just devoting as much time as possible to people with whom we already have business relationships." \[Ed.: I often turn people down because I want to spend more time with my family.]

**Being aware of your value and practicing declining opportunities is a skill.** One way to hone that skill is to develop your own system that rewards you when you exercise that skill.&#x20;

It's important to say no. Though _how_ you say it is also really important, particularly if you're in a relationship business. If you're a producer in Hollywood or a venture capitalist or a salesperson, you need to be good at saying no in a way that does more than just refuses the request -- it also builds the relationship. In those industries you don't get to choose between yes and no, you have to choose a version of no that builds your reputation in the way you want.

****[**How do I handle a customer who is being abusive towards me?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1ZkKzmvBWAoxv)****

Encountering abuse from a customer can be common and maybe you did nothing wrong.&#x20;

\[Ed.: I faced customer abuse as a CEO, and even now as an investor where we think of our founders as customers, abuse can happen – albeit rarely. When I was running an online media company, a chief marketing officer at one of our biggest advertisers, a huge global corporation, called me and screamed at me, saying they would threaten to pull all of our ads unless we changed a piece of content on our site.]

Start by taking care of yourself. Respond from a centered place. Do whatever you need to do in that moment to regulate your emotions. Take a breath. Talk to your team to get a second opinion, or see if someone else should help mediate.&#x20;

**Ask yourself "what boundary is this person is crossing?"** A useful tool for thinking about boundaries: if this person treated somebody else, not yourself (maybe a teammate, or another customer, or somebody else in the community) in this way, what line would they be crossing? Sometimes that line is known to the person. Sometimes it's just a basic standard of human behavior. When [Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded on the House floor to her colleague's name calling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LI4ueUtkRQ0), the House didn't need a rule against what he called her. It helps to imagine what the person knows because you want to anticipate their response when you raise it.

**Describe the boundary and the consequence, and then act on the consequence.** And while this sounds simple, it's hard to do.

When you're handling this type of situation remotely (i.e., any way other than in person), you need to state the boundary even more clearly. For example, refuse to participate in conversations where a customer calls you names. And if that behavior happens again, tell the customer you'll disengage from the conversation permanently. A steeper consequence would be rejecting them as a customer entirely. First, try to give them a more modest consequence, but you must create a consequence. If there's no consequence to crossing a boundary, then it's just talk.

You of course may need to consider the business consequence of losing the customer. There are some industries where many customers are abusive. Then you may need to decide whether you can survive and thrive, doing it your way, or whether you need to change your circumstances (by going to another company or another industry, if you're able to do that). These are hard choices, and we do the best we can do. The important part is to see what choices you can make, and avoid accepting that you must accept any form of abuse.

When you address abuse, try to do it compassionately because chances are the person is not a bad person. They may be having a bad day, they may be making a mistake, they may have a different worldview. If you can try to be compassionate toward them, your chance of getting what you want goes up.&#x20;

Once you've handled the immediate situation, ask yourself, "What have I learned from this? And how do I expand from there?" For example, if the boundary was unsaid before and you think it should be said explicitly, you could update your company policies (e.g., community terms and conditions on a website) so you can have something to which to point. A post-mortem exercise like a [Five whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five\_whys) exercise might be helpful, even if you do it privately.&#x20;

### Meetings

#### [What do I do if I'm in a meeting and I'm not actually sure what I'm meant to be doing?](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1ypJdwDjNXRGW)

There's lots of advice about how to _run_ a meeting. Try to find advice about how to _participate_ in a meeting, without being that person who derails the meeting or whatever.&#x20;

Some people say, "if you're not sure why you should be there, just don't go to the meeting." (Ed.: For better or worse, almost all progress in some occupations, like government, happens in meetings. For the first six months I worked in City Hall in New York, I came home at the end of every day and said to my roommates, "I don't even know why they still have me there. What am I meant to be doing in these conversations? I don't get it." One day, it just clicked for me. I can now land in any meeting and figure out what I should be doing.)&#x20;

Before you join the meeting, there are things you can do. Somebody invited you. You can ask, "Why do you want me in this meeting? Is there something specific you're hoping I'll contribute?" You can review who's going to be there and do your homework about them. \[Ed.: I'll often, even today, when I'm in a meeting with a few people and see a name I don't recognize, look them up and try to figure out who they are.] Sometimes you'll just have a sense that you should just be in the meeting and you won't quite know why, but you'll just have a feeling about it.

Developing the skill of figuring out which meetings to attend might require going to a bunch of bad meetings!

During the meeting, ask yourself, what are the roles of all the individuals there? And what is their interest, for what they're hoping to get out of this meeting? The stated agenda is rarely an accurate picture of everyone's underlying interests. (Skip the stupid meeting advice about always having an agenda beforehand. In the real world, most very good meetings lack an explicit agenda set in advance -- they usually have a one-thought topic, like "decide on next year's marketing budget.")

Once you know others' roles and likely interests, think about their perspective on why you are there. What do they think you can bring? Maybe the answer is nothing -- which doesn't mean you have to bring nothing. At least you know their perspective. And then you think about your own role and interest.

\[Ed. Here's an example. I got called into a meeting in city government, where there were people from two different city agencies talking with a non-profit about a real estate project. I was unclear on why they were all there and talking. And then I realized, "Okay, this non-profit is trying to buy the land. This first city agency owns the land and is trying to figure out whether to sell it. This other city agency wants to figure out how to get more housing on it. They're not actually all connecting with each other." And then I realized, "Okay, I'm here to see if I can connect the dots because I work for City Hall." I just asked what we were all there to figure out. In explaining it to me, the newcomer, they all got on the same page.]

You may think that what you need to do is comment in a meeting, when often asking a question is better. "Are we all here to do \_\_\_\_\_? Just confirming."

Sometimes, given the power dynamics in a meeting, you may feel uncomfortable even doing that. In a 15-person meeting it may rub too many people the wrong way to ask "what are we all here to do?" It's an elaborate cultural dance, which you practice and learn.

**After the meeting**, ask for feedback. The question is timing and dosage. Who do you ask, and when ,and how much? \[Ed.: I remember in my very first job, I was a management consultant. After every meeting, I'd go to my boss and be say, "I want some feedback. How did I do?" And that must have been annoying. A needy puppy. Don't be like I was.] Think ,if you were in that person's shoes, when would you appreciate to be asked?&#x20;

#### [How do I prepare for my first 1-1 meeting with my boss? ](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1BRJjYalnmBGw)

(It's mostly likely a terrific thing that your boss wants to talk with you individually -- it's a chance to work with them more effectively.)\
\
Ask if your boss any expectations for the meeting so you can prepare effectively. Sometimes your boss may have a favored format (in which case, if it makes sense, try to follow it). In other cases, you may want to drive the agenda.

The tone and style will vary from person to person. Some people like walking catch-ups and they want to hear what's going on with your family. If you like sharing that, please do. Some people want a bulleted list. Try learning the preference of your boss.&#x20;

In general, you want to accomplish two things: (1) inform them about what's happening and (2) make asks (how can they help you get unstuck, for example, or give you advice on some issue on which you're struggling).

The level of preparation and the substance of the conversation can change depending on the cadence (weekly, monthly, etc.). The less frequent, the more you should prepare.

Software is often useful, for example having a running document with a list of priorities enables you to know the content from a previous meeting and any follow-up items. You can then set expectations for next time you meet...

****[**How many people should I invite to my meeting?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1dRKZZlrNeoKB)****

Maybe the answer is zero. Every time you think about having a meeting, ask yourself, "Do I really need to have a meeting?" Meetings can be extremely effective, but also they're very likely to be a waste of time.&#x20;

Think about what you're trying to achieve, and know that as you have a greater number of people in the room, the higher the likelihood that the meeting will no longer be about discussion but will be more about delivery of information. Are you trying to brainstorm, have a conversation? Your meeting objective should shape who is in the room. (In a younger organization like a startup, the communication patterns can often be fluid enough that a DM channel of four people can take the place of a meeting.)

Meetings are weird because you call them with an idea in mind and then you get people in a room – and  sometimes other people want to be in the meeting for one reason or another. So suddenly you have eight people in a room on a random Tuesday at 2:00 PM, and maybe there's another topic that's a better use of the group's time. Maybe an important engineering manager is going to be in the room who can make some desired changes; you should "release the agenda" accordingly to accomplish the most important thing with that group of people.

It's worth noting that standing (i.e., recurring) meetings have a totally different pattern from one-off meetings. What often happens with standing meetings is that people just keep showing up. Regularly think to yourself, "Does this still makes sense or do we need this meeting at all?"

\[Ed.: I remember when I first started Bloomberg Beta, the then CEO of Bloomberg, Dan Doctoroff, wanted to do one-on-ones with his direct reports, once every two weeks or so. And then at some point he sent an email saying, "Enough of these one-on-ones, I'm done." And my first reaction was to wonder, "Uh oh, did I just get like kicked out of the information flow?" And then I realized, "No, this makes total sense. I can get meetings when I _need_ to get them." It's about a flow of decisions, not a single decision.]

[**What do I do if I think I'm being left out of meetings?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1OwGWLoEBQMJQ)****

Start by understanding the context. How do you know you're being left out? How much does it matter?

Do you have visibility into other people's calendars and see meetings where you feel you should be in the room and you're not? Figure that out, understand your context, and look at all the data you have to see if there's a consistent pattern where there's a certain type of meeting, or a certain group of people with whom you think you should be collaborating.

Ask yourself why this meeting is important and why you should be in the room. Is it about "status" -- you want to be seen as important enough to be there? (You might want to question whether that's really true -- many successful people see it as a blessing to be able to do their work without attending meetings.) Maybe the people in the meeting are delegating follow-ups to you and you feel you're missing context you need to do them well (or decide whether to do them). If your follow-up action from this meeting is something as simple as shooting off an email, it might not be necessary for you to attend the 45-minute discussion about it. But if there's material work for you that comes out of a meeting, it may be worth asking to join.&#x20;

There can be valid reasons for meetings to only include some people and not you. Sometimes it doesn't make sense to have a 20-person meeting, and while you'd be additive, the person who is running the meeting wants to keep the group smaller; or maybe if they invite you they need to invite many others.

Ask yourself, "What is the desired outcome for me from attending this meeting?" What is it about you being in this meeting that will materially affect what happens afterwards? With this context, does it make sense for you to ask to join?

**How you ask to join a meeting is dependent on your reason for wanting to join and the type of meeting.**&#x20;

If it's a one-time meeting and you're not on the invitation list and you hear about it, it might just be an error and you could go to the admin or calendar invite owner and ask, "was I supposed to be in that meeting?" If they say, "I'm not sure. Talk to such and such," you can just ask them and they might say, "How did I forget to include you?"

For recurring meetings, you need to figure out who has the power to put you in the room. Sometimes it could be your boss. Sometimes it could be the host of the meeting. And ask them why you aren't there, so you understand -- and, if it makes sense, explain to them the reason why you think it'd be good for the organization for you to attend. (It's OK to admit it might be good personally for you; ideally that's a secondary consideration behind what's best for the organization.)

With many of us now working at home, some organizations have leaned into having open calendars so people can see who's doing what, when. In this case, in the right context, maybe you can just be explicit and say, "Hey, I saw that you're chatting with so-and-so. I think it's relevant for me because X. Do you mind if I join?"

**Sometimes the answer is just to show up.** You could burn bridges depending on the situation, especially if somebody said, "No, don't come." But oftentimes if they didn't say that explicitly and you're there, it might not be that big of a deal. Use your judgment.&#x20;

\[Ed.: One situation where I decided to just "show up" was when I started a new job at News Corp. My project was to work with MySpace's founders on helping fight child predators on the site. I'd spoken to the CEO before starting the job -- and then on my first day, he didn't respond to me when I asked to talk about next steps (or email about them) I called him, no call back. I talked to his admin, who danced the CEO-defense dance. I was in New York, and they were in LA -- so I decided to just fly there that night. I showed up in their office and said "I'm here to meet the CEO." It was awkward for about a half hour, as the various handlers figured out whether I was legit -- and then the CEO came out, we talked, and worked together well for years. Why was I left out? Because these were just not people who responded to meeting requests or emails from folks who they didn't know, so I had to get creative. There's always another card to play, so I took the chance.]

**The most common error people make when they aren't in a meeting is to default to assuming they need to be there**, without a good reason. The person on the other side of the equation will likely think, "Why? Consider it a blessing that you don't have to be in that meeting. You could go get some work done."

[**What do I do if I have a meeting scheduled for an hour and I'm five minutes in and I'm not going to move forward. Do I try to weasel out of the meeting politely? If so, how?**](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1mnGelXLEaQKX?t=14m1s)****

Do your work beforehand, to avoid burning someone's time on something you could have learned quickly. \[Ed.: This is part of why Bloomberg Beta publishes our [operating manual](https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Manual) on the Internet. We avoid the risk of somebody sitting down and saying, "You mean you're not... a video game investor?"]

Even when you do your work beforehand, it still happens that someone books a meeting and it becomes clear very quickly that you won't move forward. Try to put the power back in the other person's hands, saying something like, "If you want, we can certainly continue talking, but I respect that your time is precious and I'm not going to move forward." (In the case of startups, founders are often pitching investors, struggling to get on their calendars. Ironically, the founder's time is actually much more precious -- even if they were more flexible on scheduling the meeting -- because if they're not doing something, software isn't getting made, sales aren't happening, etc.

\[Ed.: I once had a founder tell _me_ after five minutes that they were going to leave because it was clear I didn't like their business. They were right. I took the meeting because they were family of a good friend. I did truly believe their time would be better spent elsewhere, and while uncomfortable at the time, I admired their courage for leaving.]

### Feedback

#### [How do I respond to unconstructive feedback?](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1DXxyeWdpeExM)

They say feedback is a gift. It's true -- but a gift is supposed to make you feel good, and feedback rarely does!

There's a distinction between feedback where you find the _delivery_ unconstructive, vs. the _substance_.

In both cases, **the first thing: just stop.** We have a natural reaction to defend. \[Ed.: I once made this big presentation to 50+ people, including a co-founder of the company where I worked. I was proud of the new idea I was pitching. And the co-founder heard me out and then said, "this is a really dumb idea." I could feel myself getting flushed. The first thing I had to do was stop, avoid merely reacting.] Instead of reacting, respond from a place where you feel centered. If you're unable to do that, it's okay to stop and say, "I really want to hear you, but I'm not in a place where I can hear you right now. I would love to talk about it later." Draw a boundary, walk away, and come back later -- that's better than responding.

**Then ask questions for clarification** -- especially if you feel it was the delivery which was unconstructive. Remember to be curious before furious. Listen and make sure you understand what they say. Thank them. Try to say thank you even if you're gritting through your teeth.

Usually you'll be tempted to give "feedback on feedback" or to respond to the substance -- it's best to avoid that, too. Avoid responding with an agenda in mind. **Feedback is best as a one-way transaction.** Receive. Say, "Thank you. I hear you. I will try to take that into account." And then if you want to come back later, that's fine.

Last, remember: **context is queen** (because she's truly in charge). The specific context that matters here is the relationship between you and the person giving the feedback. It's really different if somebody is giving you feedback about how you're showing up around issues of race, vs. a coworker giving you feedback about the Google Doc that you just wrote, vs. a boss.

**Feedback is about the giver as much as it is about you.** (Avoid using that knowledge to disqualify the feedback by thinking, "well, that's just their opinion" or, "they think that because...") Treat the feedback as valuable information about them -- they're telling you something you wouldn't have known, they're revealing their inner life. We make so many assumptions about people; feedback is one way to [get across the net](https://medium.com/org-hacking/feedback-staying-on-your-side-of-the-net-6d14f4b0b170).

### Working for someone

#### [What do I do if my manager (or someone with power over me) asks me to do something with which I disagree?](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1YqJDpPyzBVJV)

**There are different kinds of disagreements. Some are just over taste.** Let's say you're a journalist and you thought the headline should read X, somebody else thought Y, and they picked the other one. Those generally follow power structures in organizations. They can be really damaging, especially if they accumulate over time. A disagreement of taste, once, might feel like, "Okay, I thought the color on that page should have been blue. And they thought turquoise, whatever, no big deal." If it happens repeatedly, you may start to question the judgment of those who are in power in the organization. Then taste disagreements can morph into the second kind of disagreement, which is where you think the other person, or the organization, asked you to do something that is just stupid, a really bad idea.

**Some disagreements are over something you think is stupid;** let's pick an example: you think your company's first market should be selling to dentists, and they're telling you instead to sell to doctors. You have to vocalize and escalate. Many people (wrongly) assume, "well, I'm just not powerful enough to be allowed to say what I think." Most people speak up too infrequently. You're getting paid to express your judgment, so speak up! Say, "I think this is a bad idea because..."

You'd be shocked how much of the time the other person agrees. Sometimes they might not care. Either way, you'll learn something about them, or about the organization. It's up to you to vocalize.

How you do that depends on where you work, on your personal approach, and on the other people involved (their roles, and their personal styles). In some cases, you might speak up forcefully in a meeting and in others you might leave a comment on a document or send an email. Remember that asking a question can be as powerful as making a statement -- and safer for you.

It's less about _whether_ you object, it's about _how._ That how is so specific to the individual, and to the culture of the organization. It's almost like asking how to give somebody a compliment -- the right way depends on the context.

Sometimes people object in a way that reveals they lack savvy, or harms others. And then that person often gets confused and they think, "Oh, they didn't want me to speak up." (Usually, it's more about the way in which you did it.)

**After you vocalize, consider whether to escalate** -- try to talk to others in the organization about the issue.

**Avoid using a pocket veto.** "Oh, I think that decision was stupid. So I'll _say_ that I'm going to do it, but I'm actually not going to do it." That's just phony.&#x20;

Stupidity, if it repeats, might make you feel less committed to the organization. "Maybe this company just has a dumb strategy." You might start thinking, "Well, do I still want to lend my name here?" If you have the power to leave and go somewhere else, you might want to consider that.&#x20;

After differences in taste and over whether a choice is stupid, **the third kind of disagreement is the hardest -- where you think you're being asked to do something unethical**. Nobody has the power to _compel_ you to do anything. It's all just a question of what it costs you to refuse. First, vocalize -- object. "I don't feel right about doing that." See how the organization responds.

Then escalate, which can be done differently over issues of ethics. "Could I talk to two or three other people before we go through with that?" Often, shining a light on some issue will make it go away.&#x20;

Last, you can organize; reach out to others who are in a similar position to you in the organization. \[Ed.: [This happened at Facebook](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-01/facebook-employees-criticize-zuckerberg-s-inaction-over-trump?sref=SlyZKZPP).] "What if we worked together and expressed an opinion on this?" Be careful, because your employer could retaliate against you. In the U.S., laws may protect you in some instances.

If your company asks you to do something unethical, you can ultimately say, "I'm just not going to do this." You get to decide, and you just have to pay the price of your decisions. It's a skill: the tradecraft of speaking up is something that really takes practice to learn. One researcher calls it [giving voice to values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlpBywBprBA). Often it's less about knowing what is ethical, and more about acting on what you know to be right. \[Ed.: Over the course of my career, I disagreed enough with others that realized I just wanted to be in charge -- and have others disagree with me. I have to acknowledge my privilege here: I may think about objecting differently than somebody who brings less or other forms of privilege.]

To feel empowered sometimes you'll introspect about your own values, and think about how they align -- or misalign -- with the place where you work. Dilemmas are a tool to learn our own beliefs. Over time, seek to work for organizations, in roles, where you can work completely consistently with your values.

(Managing what to do when you ask somebody to do something and you know they disagree with it, is a whole other side of the coin. It can sometimes be valid, and sometimes not. As you take on more leadership, the issues that reach you tend to be issues of values, as opposed to issues of skills or competence. Like when you call customer support, and the first person can't help you, you get escalated to tier two, and eventually to some technical wizard -- when you're in a leadership role in the organization, by the time issues reach you, they've gone through all the easy filters. Those are opportunities to articulate the values of the organization, through the choices that you make -- for organizations, too, dilemmas are a tool to learn beliefs.)

[**What should I do while my boss is on vacation?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1eaKbzRmnEXKX)****

Consider what your relationship is with your boss, since this will impact how you want to handle their time off. You can try to anticipate what your boss may need from you.&#x20;

Before your boss goes on vacation, be proactive and ask questions like, "Would it help you if on the day you came back, I had something ready that outlined what happened while you were away?" Or, "Would it help if I cleared your calendar, or took away some responsibility?"

(Avoid making guesses about what would be helpful and instead bring them a proposal. Saying, "Here's what I think would be helpful. What do you think?" is very different from saying, "What would you like when you return from vacation?" One puts the onus back on them to figure things out.)

While your boss is out, understand and anticipate how things will change day to day for you. Having them away might mean that you have more time -- time to invest in yourself and focus on getting things done that aren't as urgent but are still important. Consider doing "deep work," something proactive that you have wanted to spend time on and now have more flexibility to do – and is something you can share when your boss comes back.

Think about your team members, who may have a closer or different relationship with your boss, and how you can help them while the boss is away. This can play a big role in making sure that your boss's return is a smooth one. Team roles can shift when one person goes away, maybe the boss, or maybe just a teammate. Think about who is covering specific projects and who may be your surrogate boss during this period.

Put yourself in your boss's shoes. When they get back, they won't want random things dropped on their plate. Be selective, wait until Wednesday before you raise something that doesn't need to be raised on Monday when they're getting back to things.&#x20;

### Working remotely

#### [How do I get experience about how organizations work, if I'm working from home?](https://www.pscp.tv/roybahat/1dRKZZBAVNXKB)

There's been so little experience with work-from-home companies or roles (in all of the business world), that we still don't know how to do them well. There's a set of things that you can learn better when you work from home. You can learn how to be more explicit in your communication. You can learn how formal processes of decisionmaking work. You can learn how to use digital tools.&#x20;

The early pioneers in distributed work, companies like Automattic or other open source based companies like MySQL, InVision, or GitLab, must be figuring out tricks that others don't know -- as to how to make learning happen.

Is there something that you cannot learn by working from home? Of course. There are many things that happen in person. Body language, serendipity.

One soil for learning about work is diversity of experiences. That's why diverse teams matter so much. For any individual plotting a career, you want to be exposed to different cultures and situations and get a little bit of a feel for them.

Make an effort to learn other people’s communication styles. Be mindful of what platform you use to share certain information.

Many forms of communication can be utilized in remote work. Unfortunately, some communication methods lead to more misunderstandings than others. When receiving and interpreting messages, keep the sender’s communication style in mind.

People rarely discuss their communication style. Pay attention to how people communicate and look for trends. \[Ed.: [Emma Varvaloucas ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmavarvaloucas/)has a friend that only uses periods in text messages when she is angry. Emma knows to look out for the periods to gauge her friend’s emotions.]&#x20;

All communication styles flow from your in-person communication styles, so learning someone’s communication style through in-person interaction is ideal. Unfortunately, this isn’t always possible. In this case, starting with high bandwidth channels that let you see the person through video and hear their voice are good alternatives. Knowing someone’s cadence, tone, and sense of humor allows you to translate it onto other platforms.

In terms of how much you communicate, it may be useful to over communicate and then gradually pull back. Ask for input about how often you communicate, “Do you need as much communication as you have been getting? Should I do less?”

Use an appropriate channel based on what you are communicating. People would rather receive negative things in private, so make an effort to send them a private message rather than posting it on a public discord channel. If you need to handle a sensitive topic, choose a high bandwidth method over something more impersonal like email.

Trust your intuition. You will get a feel for what you need to do. \[Ed.: Emma writes a weekly newsletter that they publish at [The Progress Network. ](https://theprogressnetwork.org/)When she started, she would send the newsletter to the founder of the network in advance so he could check it. When Emma never got a response, she realized she could stop sending it.]

Take cues from your teammates about how your communication is landing. Just because you put information out there doesn’t mean it is being received. If your message is important, ask for confirmation that it arrived.&#x20;

Learn how other people communicate and try to use an appropriate communication method.

#### [What should I do when I'm feeling distant from my coworkers?](https://www.pscp.tv/w/cclXwzFsWktwWXhYSnhvam58MW1ueGVsYlh6ZVBKWH2LjG-MHZRIM3Df1VjmeRJ4pzrvHyltvk8vv9LFQnL1)

There are two kinds of distance that we often conflate: logistical distance, how to get things done when you're feeling removed from others, and emotional distance. Try to be specific about what you're feeling and recognize it's natural to feel removed sometimes.

Experiment and see what works. Take more time to check in during a meeting. \[Ed.: our twice-weekly team meetings start with 20 minutes asking how everyone is doing generally, outside work]. Leaders have a special role: make sure you create an environment where communication can happen, where people feel okay about revealing they feel distant.&#x20;

The software you choose can be useful, too. (Leaders' "tool-picking" power matters.) For example, a daily standup tool, essential to the Agile software development process, may help your team more generally to know where you're blocked (if it's "logistical distance," in particular). [Range](http://range.co/) \[ed.: #proudinvestor] is a tool that helps with daily team check-ins: it addresses both logistical and emotional distance.[ Icebreaker](http://icebreaker.video/) is a video chat tool \[ed.: #proudinvestor] designed for people to get to know each other. Reward the behaviors you want to see -- consider [Bonusly](https://bonus.ly/) \[ed.: #proudinvestor] for that, dropping little thank-yous as you go through your day.

Try to have a good time. It's hard with everything going on, a real luxury. Play games. If it's appropriate for your team, try a virtual escape room or sending Lego instructions to one person and the kit to another person (they have to explain to each other how to build it).

Avoid adding a burden to people who may already feel too much of one: be aware of time zones, familial obligations, etc. Maybe somebody who is a different race, or gender, or has some other difference from you, may be experiencing things differently than you are. Try to be aware of that.

****[**How do I handle conflict when working remotely?**](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1nAJEAnZlLlJL)****

When we hear the word "conflict," we imagine something bad. Yet almost all progress at work involves resolving conflict or tension. This can mean an emotionally loaded conversation. Maybe you need to give somebody their annual performance review. Or you need to negotiate with somebody who you haven't negotiated with before.&#x20;

In person, we can use many tools to communicate wisely in a situation with the potential for conflict. We can use body language, timing and nature of when and how we approach someone, choosing where to meet, etc. Those options go out the window when you're remote. Start from scratch and assume you no longer know what you're doing.&#x20;

**Ask yourself if you've imagined a conflict or if it's really there.** \[Ed.: A mentor of mine calls this "curious before furious."] Be honest with yourself about what you really _know_ vs. just assume.

If you're acting on something of which you're unsure**, focus on learning as opposed to resolving the conflict**. Prepare by thinking about scenarios for how the other person might respond. Let's say you need to let somebody go. What are the different ways the person might react? The purpose of thinking about scenarios is to avoid being caught off guard.

**Telegraph in advance to the other person** that the conversation that might be loaded. Be explicit and say something like, "I want to have a conversation with you. It might be pretty challenging." Or, "I want to have our annual review. I know that usually we'd get to sit down and do this over a cup of coffee..." You'll have a better conversation if they're prepared.

When working remotely, it is harder to know what other people are doing during the workday. Explicitly ask for their time. "Could I grab 10 minutes from you at the end of the day? I wanted to tell you something," so that you're not interrupting. You can give the other person control over the timing of the conversation.

Once you're ready to communicate the conflict, how do you make the interaction authentic?

You can consult resources: [Authentic Relating](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1\_WsCxCac2sHxmI6yzIJnruNHg5geeTzWGsAQdfnJvBA/edit), books like [Difficult Conversations](https://www.amazon.com/Difficult-Conversations-Discuss-What-Matters/dp/0143118447), frameworks like the [nonviolent communications model](https://www.nonviolentcommunication.com/learn-nonviolent-communication/4-part-nvc/). \[Ed.: My kids have learned at school about [I statements](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1\_WsCxCac2sHxmI6yzIJnruNHg5geeTzWGsAQdfnJvBA/edit).]

Stick to the stuff you truly know -- your feelings, your views. Go slowly -- this is especially important remotely. When something unexpected happens, resist leading with your reactions. Take a breath. Try to respond intentionally. When you're remote, the mute button is your friend -- it can prevent you from running your mouth when your emotions get the better of you.

Afterward, go back to the person afterward and check in: "Hey, that might've been difficult. How did you feel about that?" It's even more important to do remotely.
